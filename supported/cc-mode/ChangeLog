2005-11-30  Aland Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Release 5.31.

2005-11-30  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Spelling and minor typographical changes.

2005-11-29  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-awk.el:  Spelling corrections.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-paren): Only call the
	`blink-paren-function' for a CLOSE parenthesis.

	* cc-defs.el: Change "(cc-external-require 'cl)" to
	"(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))".  (The change came from
	savannah - I don't understand it.)

	* cc-engine.el: Add an autoload to c-guess-basic-syntax (From
	savannah.)
	
	* cc-langs.el: Add "(cc-external-require 'cl)".

	* cc-mode.el (c-font-lock-init): "Add (font-lock-lines-before
	. 1)".
	
	* cc-subword.el: Add a dummy `c-subword-mode' for Emacsen which
	lack `define-minor-mode'.  (Currently Emacs <21.  We might do this
	function properly in the future).

2005-11-28  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-defs.el, cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el: New macros
	c-sentence-end and c-default-value-sentence end, to cope with
	Emacs 22's new function `sentence-end'.

2005-11-26  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-show-syntactic-information): Solved the compat
	issue using `c-put-overlay' and `c-delete-overlay'.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-show-syntactic-information): change the
	highlighting mechanism so it will work in XEmacs too.

	Remove several unused dynamic bindings.

	* cc-defs.el: Insert c-int-to-char.

	* cc-langs.el (c-nonsymbol-token-char-list): Insert a call to the

	* cc-fonts.el (c-make-syntactic-matcher): New internal helper.

	(c-cpp-matchers, c-basic-matchers-before): Use the `eval'
	construct to make the indirect face lookup work in XEmacs.

	(c-cpp-matchers): Append the negation char face to the existing
	fontification, so that the cpp face doesn't disappear.  Use
	`c-make-syntactic-matcher' to avoid negation chars in comments and
	strings.

2005-11-24  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-negation-char-face-name): New variable to map to

	by c-subword-mode.
	(iii) "Config Basics": change the troublesome "@itemize @w" to
	"@itemize @asis".
	(iv) Eliminate the "@defvr {LIST}" construct in "Adding Styles".
	Bring descriptions of subsidiary matters into the definition of
	the style description by shifting an "@end".

2005-11-22  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi, cc-subword.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-mode.el: Rename
	"c-subword-move-mode" as "c-subword-mode".

	* cc-mode.texi, cc-subword.el: cc-subword.el: In
	c-forward-subword-internal, check that the regexp doesn't match a
	null string.  This can happen, e.g., in Info Mode, where ' has the
	syntax of a word constituent.

	cc-mode.texi:
	(i) "Subword Movement": Say that subword-move-mode is available in
	non-CC Modes.
	(ii) "Config Basics": Add a recommendation to beginners to use the
	top-level setq mechanism.

	(v) Reinstated the description of `c-toggle-auto-hungry-state'.

	* cc-mode.el: Remove the binding C-c C-y for c-toggle-hungry-state

	* cc-cmds.el: Reinsert c-toggle-auto-hungry-state (but with no
	binding).

2005-11-21  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Added tty suitable bindings for C-c <delete> and C-c
	C-<delete>.  (To the c-hungry- delete functions).

2005-11-21  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Added autoload directive for `c-subword-move-mode'
	for use in older emacsen.

2005-11-20  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el:
	(i) Insert a binding for C-c C-backspace into
	c-bind-special-erase-keys which works in TTYs.
	(ii) Make sure that when file styles are used, any explicitly

	this by calling `hack-local-variables' a second time.

	* cc-vars.el: Add language specific customization widgets for AWK
	to c-doc-comment-style, c-require-final-newline and
	c-default-style.  Add a defcustom for awk-mode-hook.  Give
	c-syntactic-element and c-syntactic-context doc-strings by
	directly setting their `variable-documentation' propery.  This
	allows Emacs 22.1 to read these with C-h v.

	* cc-awk.el: Apply a tidy-up patch (from Stefan Monnier).

2005-11-20  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Mention gtkdoc.

	* cc-mode.texi: The concept index also contains the keys. Make
	that more obvious so that the keys are found more easily.

	* cc-mode.texi: Updated the Hungry WS Deletion section on the
	details about the C-c C-<backspace> bindings etc.

	* cc-mode.texi: Added a section about the subword minor mode.

	* cc-fonts.el, cc-vars.el (gtkdoc-font-lock-doc-comments,
	gtkdoc-font-lock-doc-protection, gtkdoc-font-lock-keywords):
	GtkDoc patterns contributed by Masatake YAMATO.

	(c-doc-comment-style): Made GtkDoc default in C mode.

2005-11-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	`normal-erase-is-backspace-hook' to bind C-c C-<delete> correctly.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-hungry-delete): New function to fix <delete> key
	behavior in XEmacs according to `delete-forward-p'.
	C.f. `c-electric-delete'.

2005-11-18  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: DVI stuff: Remove the quotes from "GNU Emacs
	Manual" and friends.  Complete several cross references with their
	fifth parameter (the name of the printed manual).

	"Indentation Commands": Tidy up `c-indent-command', putting the
	variables `c-tab-always-indent' and `c-insert-tab-function' inside
	its description.  Inserted some "printed manual names" into cross
	references where they were missing.  Move description of
	`indent-for-comment' into ...

	"Comment Command": A new @section under "Commands"; it contains
	the description of `indent-for-comment'; this was taken out of
	"Indentation Commands".  Add GNU Emacs's new name `comment-dwim'
	for this function.

	"Sample .emacs File": Change "@example" to "@verbatim" so that the
	text isn't indented.  Reorder the Lisp forms.

2005-11-08  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: "Configuration Basics": Add a note that ".emacs"
	means "whatever initialization file you fancy".  Also, another
	note that the mode hooks are good places to put personal
	preferences.

	"Performance Issues": Remove the recommendation to put defun
	braces at column 0, replacing it with a historical remark.

	"Limitations and Known Bugs": State that C++ templates aren't yet
	handled fully.

2005-11-06  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Renamed @chapter "Getting Connected" to "Getting
	Started" and @chapter "Config Strategies" to "Config Basics".

	"Getting Started": Added "quick fix" configurations for four of
	the most common requests (c-basic-offset, c-set-style,
	c-electric-mode, <RET> should indent NL).

	"FAQ": Permuted the questions a little.  Added "How can I change
	the indent level from 4 spaces to 2 spaces?".  Added several cross
	references.

2005-11-05  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Move c-toggle-hungry-state from "C-c C-d" to "C-c C-y".  Give
	  c-hungry-backspace and c-hungry-delete-forward permanent key bindings.

	* cc-mode.texi: Document the new state of affairs: Nodes changed: "Minor
	  Modes", "Hungry WS Deletion", "Sample .emacs File"

	* cc-mode.texi:
	"Style Variables": New @section explaining what style variables are and
	  how to set them.
	"Permanent Customization": Removed this @section, since its contents have
	  been moved elsewhere.
	"c-offsets-alist": New @section

	Removed much commented out material, including @examples in the Line-Up
	  sections.

	"Config Strategies": (i) Added a summary of style variables; (ii)
	  Corrected the priority of settings made by "File Local Variables";
	  (iii) Clarified and corrected how top-level `setq's interact with
	  styles; (iv) Added a terse but accurate description of the "user"
	  style.
	"Style Variables": Took over most of the stuff from "Styles", its
	  parent.  Added a @pxref to each item in the list of style variables.
	"Built-in Styles": Corrected the description of the "user" style.  Other
	  styles DO NOT inherit from it - they inherit from the factory defaults
	  in c-fallback-style.
	"Adding Styles": Clarification of inheritance from c-fallback-style.

	"Hanging Braces": Replace a tedious flowchart of what CC Mode does, with
	  a description of how to go about configuring the thing.
	"Custom Braces": Move description of c-syntactic-context to near the
	  top of the node, and note the other three circumstances it gets bound
	  (together with @xrefs).
	"Hanging Semicolons and Commas": Note that c-syntactic-context is bound.

	"Indentation Engine Basics": Clarify first stage of indentation process.
	"Syntactic Symbols" (and sub-nodes): Note the syntactic symbols which
	  don't have and anchor point, or have additional info in a syntactic
	  element.

	"Customizing Indentation": Stuff about c-offsets-alist has been moved to
	  its own new @section.
	"Line-Up Functions": Add a mention of the calling convention together
	  with a pointer to "Custom Line-Up".
	"Other Indentation": Clarify the whole @section.  State that File local
	  variables take precedence over all else, even settings in hooks.

2005-11-04  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-mask-paragraph): Remove the "(if t ..." construct
	which was experimentally inserted into V 5.314 (2005-08-18) to
	minimise the patch size by not changing the indentation level.

2005-11-03  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-semi&comma): Bind c-syntactic-context for
	calls to "criteria functions", for consistency with other calls to
	user functions.

2005-10-31  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-command): expunge use of
	`current-prefix-arg', since this might be the prefix arg to a
	command which calls c-indent-command as a function.  Change the
	interactive spec from "p" to "P".

2005-10-04  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	"Minor Modes": Document the command c-toggle-syntactic-indentation.
	"Analysis": Formalise the description of
	  c-show-syntactic-information to a quasi-@defun form.  Describe the new
	  feature of highlighting anchor positions.
	Make sure there's a blank line at the top of each node.

	* cc-mode.texi: "Indentation Engine Basics":
	(i) Rearrange the paragraphs more logically;
	(ii) make @dfn's out of "syntactic symbol", "anchor position" and
	  "offset(s)".
	(iii) Make an @enumeration out of the two-step indentation process.
	(iv) Add a paragraph motivating c-syntactic-indentation, complete with a
	  reference to "Config Strategies".

2005-10-02  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: "Custom Line-Up":
	(i) Increase the concision of the page.
	(ii) Comment out the example.  (Maybe this should go into its own
	  @subsection.)
	(iii) Specify precisely the conventions for a line-up function, in
	  particular, that point may not be moved.
	(iv) Add in the suggestion that c-special-indent-hook may sometimes be a
	  better idea than line-up functions.
	There are minor consequential changes on other pages.

2005-09-18  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	(i) Partition the over-large @section "Line-Up Functions".
	(ii) Expand the description of c-special-indent-hook.
	(iii) Add cross references between "Other Indentation" and "Custom
	  Line-up", emphasizing that c-special-indent-hook functions and line-up
	  functions are alternatives.

2005-09-17  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el: Amend the doc-string of c-set-style, in reponse to
	a report from Joseph Kiniry <kiniry@acm.org> that it was difficult
	to understand.

	in C++.

2005-09-09  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi ("Syntactic Analysis"): Minor amendments.
	("Syntactic Symbols"): Partition this monster into a section with
	  thirteen subsections, each of which (more or less) illustrates a coherent
	  grouping of symbols.
	  Replace the spurious references to substatement-block-intro with
	  statement-block-intro.
	  Add @ssindex entries for those symbols missing them.

2005-09-08  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Some general tidying up and clarification.  Also:
	(Hooks):  mention c-special-indent-hook
	(FAQ): Commented out the question about M-[ae] going into blocks.

2005-08-29  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	55 Changes, great and small.  Most of them are minor linguistic
	improvements, clarifications, adding xrefs, bug fixes, or the like, but
	there are also several more notable changes:
	(i) "Config Strategies": State which setting takes precedence when
	  conflicting settings are made (e.g. both in a style and in a hook).
	(ii) "Config Strategies": Add a bit about "File Styles".
	(iii) "File Styles": Fleshed out this chapter quite a bit.
	(iv) "Mode Initialization": Removed this embryonic node (which was far
	  from complete or useful) and all references to it.

2005-08-18  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-mask-paragraph): correct, so that auto-fill
	doesn't split a c-comment's last word from a hanging "*/" when a
	space is typed between them after fill-column.

	cc-defs.el: New macro c-delete-and-extract-region.

2005-06-24  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style, c-setup-paragraph-variables): Abort
	the command if we're not in a CC Mode buffer.

2005-06-13  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-C-comments): Correct indentation with
	blank comment-prefix, and a blank line as the comment's second
	line.

2005-05-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-cpp-matchers, c-basic-matchers-before):
	Incorporated the patterns added in the Emacs development branch
	for the new Emacs 22 face `font-lock-negation-char-face'.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-invalid-face-name): Use "red1" instead of "red"
	since it stands out better in xterms and DOS terminals.

	* cc-engine.el (c-literal-faces): Added
	`font-lock-comment-delimiter-face' which is new in Emacs 22.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarators): Fixed bug where the point
	could go past the limit in decoration level 2, thereby causing
	errors during interactive fontification.

2005-05-08  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	Add documention for the new electric minor mode and finish that for clean-up
	comment-close-slash.  Tidy up the structure a bit, make some minor linguistic
	improvements.  In detail:

	Change "Clean-ups" from being a section of "Custom auto-newlines) to being its
	  own section, since it documents some stuff which is independent of
	  auto-nelines.
	Change "Auto-newlines" and "Hungry WS Deletion" from being subsections of
	  "Minor Modes" to their own sections, since they're to important to hide.
	  Move "Electric Keys" alongside them, since it now bears the same
	  relationship to "Minor Modes" as "Auto-newlines" and "Hungry WS .." do.
	"Indentation Commands":  Add a convenience description of standard (X)Emacs
	  C-j.
	"Minor Modes":
	  (i) Document the new "electric minor mode" with toggle C-c C-l, and the
	    coupling between it and c-toggle-auto-newline.
	  (ii) Remove the description of the defunct `c-toggle-auto-hungry-state'.
	  (iii) Update the description of the modeline flags.
	  (iv) Recast the node considerably in the process.
	"Electric Keys and Keywords":
	  (i) Add a note that electric minor mode needs to be enabled for (most of)
	    the stuff here to work.
	  (ii) Mention the new clean-up comment-close-slash.
	  (iii) Note the electric actions which don't need electric minor mode to be
	    enabled.
	"Sample .emacs File":  Replace c-toggle-auto-hungry-state with
	  c-toggle-\(auto-newline\|hungry-state\).
	"FAQ": Add an entry "How do I stop my code jumping all over the place when I
	  type?".

2005-05-07  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: Correct previous patch to c-toggle-auto-newline.

	* cc-mode.texi: Document the new clean-up `comment-close-slash'.

	* cc-cmds.el: Make C-c C-a (`c-toggle-auto-newline') forcibly
	enable c-electric-flag.

2005-05-06  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el, cc-cmds.el: New clean-up `comment-close-slash' on
	c-electric-slash: if enabled, typing `/' just after the
	comment-prefix of a C-style comment will close that comment.

2005-05-05  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Sync with Lute Kamstra's patch from emacs-devel to
	prevent a superfluous cc-mode.ss index file being built with
	texi2dvi.

2005-05-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-basic-matchers-before, c-complex-decl-matchers):

2005-04-11  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el, cc-engine.el

	c-opt-cpp-macro-define, c-opt-cpp-macro-define-start,
	c-cpp-expr-directives): Introduced new language constants to
	control cpp syntax in a cleaner way.

	arbitrarily large blocks.  Removed hints that this function only
	would be relevant/useful in AWK.

	(c-electric-brace): Indent syntactically after the cleanups since
	lineup functions might do it differently then.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-opt-op-identifier-prefix): New
	language constant and variable.

	(c-just-after-func-arglist-p, c-after-special-operator-id,

2005-02-14  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>:

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-argcont): Ignore conses for {} pairs from
	c-parse-state, to avoid a lisp error (on bad code).

2005-04-09  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Handle operator
	declarations somewhat better in C++.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarators): Handle
	`c-decl-hangon-kwds' after the identifier name.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): When deciding whether an
	arglist is "nonempty", ignore a comment after the open paren if it
	isn't followed by a non-comment token on the same line.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Case 4: Enable heuristics
	below the point to cope with classes inside special brace lists in

2005-02-14  Kevin Ryde  <user42@zip.com.au>

	* cc-mode.texi (File Styles): Cross reference emacs file local
	variables, correction to grammatical typo.

2005-03-20  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-guess.el: Improvement contributed by Masatake YAMATO:
	Frequency is now taken into account to make a better guess.

	(cc-guess-region): Inverted the RESET argument to make it more
	convenient.  The guessed style is also merged into
	`c-offsets-alist' right away.

	(cc-guess, cc-guess-view-style): New functions.

2005-03-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-tentative-buffer-changes): No longer sets
	`inhibit-read-only' - `c-save-buffer-state' should be used anyway
	if the change always is undone.

2005-03-12  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	Implement togglable electricity:

	* cc-defs.el: Enhance c-save-buffer-state's doc-string, saying
	when it should be used.

	* cc-engine.el: Add the new buffer-local variable,
	c-electric-flag.

	* cc-langs.el: Change the name of c-toggle-auto-state to
	c-toggle-auto-newline.

	* cc-mode.el: Rename c-toggle-auto-state to c-toggle-auto-newline.

	binding C-c C-l for the new c-toggle-electric-state.

	* cc-vars.el: Make c-syntactic-indentation buffer local.

	* cc-cmds.el: Add `c-bytecomp-defun's for
	c-\(forward\|backward\)-subword.
	(c-update-modeline): Add the new modeline flag `l' for
	`c-electric-flag'.  Make the auto-newline flag `a' dependent on
	`l'.
	(c-toggle-auto-state): Rename it to `c-toggle-auto-newline'.  Make
	the old name an alias of the new name.
	(c-toggle-auto-hungry-state): Removed.
	(c-toggle-electric-state): New function.
	c-electric-\(pound\|brace\|slash\|star\|semi&comma\|colon\|lt-gt\|paren\|continued-statement\):
	Adapt these functions to do electric things only when
	c-electric-flag is non-nil.
	(c-point-syntax, c-brace-newlines, c-try-oneliner): Extract these
	new functions from c-electric-brace.
	(c-point-syntax): Add a check for "virtual semicolons" in AWK
	mode, so that the tentative extra newline doesn't change the
	syntax of the following brace.
	(c-electric-brace): restructure by extracting the above functions.
	Tidy up the coding somewhat.
	(c-electric-semi&comma, c-electric-colon, c-electric-paren):
	restructure a bit.

	* cc-mode.texi:
	"Electric Keys": Amend description of `<' and `>': they are also electric when
	  they are template brackets.
	"Other Commands": Add an entry for the standard Emacs command `comment-region'
	  which has CC Mode binding C-c C-c.
	"Custom Filling and Breaking": Purge the description of
	  `c-comment-prefix-regexp' of confusing gobbledygook.

2005-03-02  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	"Filling and Breaking":  Add a cross reference to "Custom Filling and
	Breaking".
	Several minor amendments.

2005-02-01  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	Merge the changes made on branch texi-0-1 back to HEAD.

2005-01-31  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	"Overview":  Get rid of reference to "AWK" section;
	"Sample .emacs FILE":  Put key bindings into c-initialization-hook;
	  Move the c-add-style call from out of the c-mode-hook.

2004-12-19  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	In the GNU/XEmacs conditional things, replace "X" by "XEMACS" for clarity.
	Rename the chapter "Indentation Engine" to "Indentation Engine Basics".
	"Indentation Commands": Add stuff about macros (taken from the old "Macro
	  Handling" chapter).
	"Other Commands":  Move the description of "c-backslash-region" into here.
	Rename "Macro Handling" to "Custom Macros", having moved the stuff other than
	  customization to other chapters.

	* cc-vars.el: Remove the erroneous (doubly inserted) patch from
	yesterday.

2004-12-18  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-show-syntactic-information): Show the anchor
	position(s) using faces.  Thanks to Masatake YAMATO for the idea.

	* cc-mode.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el
	(c-submode-indicators): Changed name from `c-auto-hungry-string'
	since it's now used to track another submode.

	(c-update-modeline): Converted to function and extended to check
	`c-subword-move-mode'.

	(c-forward-into-nomenclature, c-backward-into-nomenclature):
	Converted to compat aliases for `c-forward-subword' and
	`c-backward-subword'.

	* cc-subword.el: New functions and minor mode to handle
	SillyCapsedStyleIndentifiers, contributed by Masatake YAMATO:

	(c-forward-subword, c-backward-subword, c-mark-subword,
	c-kill-subword, c-backward-kill-subword, c-transpose-subwords,
	c-capitalize-subword, c-downcase-subword, c-upcase-subword):
	Functions corresponding to the standard word handling functions.

	(c-subword-move-mode): Minor mode that replaces all the standard
	word handling functions with their subword equivalences.

2004-12-17  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-cleanup-list): Insert a customization entry for
	one-liner-defun.

2004-12-12  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el: Give c-tentative-buffer-changes its own name in its
	def-edebug-spec.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Make the one-liner-defun clean-up
	work with empty-defun-braces.  o-l-d now compacts space before a
	comment, if this will make things fit on one line.

2004-12-05  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	"AWK Mode Defuns":  Removed this subsection, transferring its contents to
	  "Movement Commands"
	"Movement Commands":  Condensed the separate descriptions of
	  complementary -backward-* and -forward-* commands into joint
	  descriptions.

2004-12-04  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	"Introduction":  Integrated Alan more tightly into CC-Mode.  ;-)
	"Overview":  New chapter describing the structure of the manual.
	"Other Commands":  Added a description of c-macro-expand.
	"Built-in Styles":  Added a description of the new "awk" style.
	"Custom Braces" and "Hanging Semicolons and Commas":  Specify the meaning of
	  point in action functions, and that is must be preserved.
	"Clean-ups":  Document the new clean-up one-liner-defun and associated
	  variable c-max-one-liner-length.
	"Customizing Indentation" is now its own chapter rather than being a section
	  of "Indentation Engine".
	"AWK Mode:  Removed the entire chapter, moving the two remaining useful
	  sections to "Font Locking" and "Movement Commands".
	Added/Moved lots of index entries.

2004-11-29  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Add a fourth parameter `t' to the awk-mode autoload,
	so that it is interactive, hence can be found by M-x awk-mode
	whilst cc-mode is yet to be loaded.  Reported by Glenn Morris
	<gmorris+emacs@ast.cam.ac.uk>.

2004-11-28  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	Introduce an "awk" style, mainly for auto-newline and clean-ups.

	* cc-align.el: new function c-snug-1line-defun-close

	* cc-cmds.el: In c-electric-brace, add code for new clean-up
	one-liner-defun.
	
	* cc-styles.el: Add the new "awk" style.

	* cc-vars.el: Add description of one-liner-defun to
	c-cleanup-list's doc-string.  New user options,
	c-max-one-liner-length.  In c-default-style, set the default style
	for AWK to "awk".

2004-11-28  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el (c-run-mode-hooks): New helper macro to
	make use of `run-mode-hooks' which has been added in Emacs 21.1.

	(c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode, java-mode, idl-mode, pike-mode,
	awk-mode): Use it.

	(make-local-hook): Suppress warning about obsoleteness which has
	been added in Emacs 21.1.

2004-11-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-label): Fixed fontification of macros
	inside labels.

2004-11-04  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	(i) Some general tidying up, remove @ignore sections, etc.
	(ii) Firm up the mechanism for generating @xrefs to the Emacs/Xemacs
	  manual and the Elisp/Lispref manual.  There are now four macros,
	  @emacsman{}, @lispref{}, @emacsmantitle{}, @lispreftitle{} which
	  generate the filenames and titles (for the printed versions) of the
	  manuals pertinent to Emacs or XEmacs, depending on whether the makeinfo
	  variable `X' is defined or not.  The titles were taken from the
	  @settitle lines in the source files of the four manuals.  In the
	  process, the title "The Emacs Editor" has been amended to "GNU Emacs
	  Manual".

2004-10-16  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Much general tidying up of the wording.
	"Auto-newlines"
	  (i) Add a note that c-electric-* only do their stuff when last on
	    line.
	  (ii) State that a `before' auto-newline is never added if the `{'
	    etc. is "already on a newline".
	  (iii) Replace the statement of where auto-newlines go by default (it
	    was wrong and oversimplified) by a statement that the style system
	    does the configuration most of the time.
	"Custom Auto-newlines"
	  (i) Make the page what it says it is, removing the stuff which is now
	    in "Commands".
	  (ii) Add a @dfn{} for "hang", and "hanging on the left/right".
	  (iii)
	"Hanging Braces"
	  (i) Insert an @enumerated section describing the algorithm.
	  (ii) Insert a more robust description of c-hanging-braces-alist.
	  (iii)
	"Hanging Colons"
	  (i) Update this page to mirror "Hanging Braces".
	  (ii) State that the default action (if no alist entry) is to add no
	    newlines.
	"Custom Semis and Commas"
	  (i) Add clarification that criteria functions don't themselves add
	    newlines.
	  (ii) State that NLs never get added _before_ a `;' or `,'.
	  (iii)
	"Clean-ups"
	  (i) Give an actual definition of "Clean-up" for the @dfn{}. ;-)

	Moved the @section "Custom Brace and Colon Hanging" away from "Advanced
	  Customizations" to underneath "Hanging Braces", removing the spurious
	  "and Colons" from its name.
	Moved the contents of the @section "Customizing Semicolons and Commas"
	  away from "Advanced Customizations" and inserted them into "Hanging
	  Semicolons and Commas" (which previously had only a pointer into the
	  CSaC node).
	"Advanced Customization" is now almost content free.

	Add Experimental macros for "Emacs"/"XEmacs" and "Elisp"/"Lispref", in
	  the hope they might enable a better XEmacs version of the manual.

2004-10-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-align.el
	(c-append-backslashes-forward, c-delete-backslashes-forward,
	c-find-decl-spots, c-semi&comma-no-newlines-before-nonblanks):
	Compensate for return value from `forward-line' when it has moved
	but not to a different line due to eob.

2004-10-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-bos): Obsoleted in favor of
	`c-at-statement-start-p' and `c-at-expression-start-p'.

	* cc-defs.el (c-tnt-chng-record-state): Don't signal an error if
	the mark isn't set.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed anchoring in
	`objc-method-intro' and `objc-method-args-cont'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-continued-construct,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Use `c-forward-decl-or-cast-1' to more
	accurately detect functions inside functions.

2004-09-30  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	  Reorder the chapters a bit on the principle "Most basic earliest":
	  Move "Font locking" with contents to just after "Commands".
	  Move "Indentation Engine" with contents to just after "Custom Filling and
	    Breaking".
	  Move "Custom Filling and Line Breaking" to before "Custom Auto-Newlines".

2004-09-26  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	  Add a "Mode Initialization" section (as yet, content free) to
	    "Configuration Strategies".
	  Move "Minor Modes" into the "Commands" chapter.  Remove the
	    configuration instructions from its submode "Auto-newlines".  Outline
	    the default configuration for auto-newlines here.
	  Rename the old "Auto-newline insertion" to "Customizing Auto-newline
	    Mode" and make it a @chapter in its own right, containing four
	    sections.  The content of this @chapter is yet to be adapted.
	  Amend the descriptions in "Minor Modes" of the key sequences, using
	    @table rather than an unbroken textual paragraph.
	  Amend "Electric Keys", so that there is explicit reference to
	    "Clean-ups" in the right places.  All electric actions are now
	    collected together in this section.
	  Condense the description of '*' and '/' in Electric keys.
	  In "Clean-ups" insert "@tie{}" where a critical space was getting lost
	    in line wrap.
	  Tidy up a lot of wording.
	  Introduce an experimental facility which will build either a GNU Emacs
	    or an XEmacs specific info file.

2004-09-26  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-at-expression-start-p): New function like
	`c-at-statement-start-p' that additionally recognizes commas and
	expression parentheses as delimiters.

2004-09-24  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-awk.el: Add character classes (e.g. "[:alpha:]") into AWK
	Mode's regexps.

2004-09-19  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Move the page "Hungry WS Deletion" into the
	"Commands" chapter, and revise this node for (hopefull) increased
	clarity.

2004-09-18  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Reduce the length of many node names, (following
	suggestion on emacs-devel).  Tidy up some of the wording.

2004-09-17  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:   Added ACM to the list of authors.
	  Renamed "Other Electric Commands" to "Electric Keys and Keywords"
	  In "Electric Keys and Keywords", added descriptions of {, }, :, ;, ,,,
	    and tidied up the wording a bit.
	  Tidied up the wording and presentation of "Configuration Strategies".
	  In "Customizing Filling and Line Breaking", expanded the description of
	    c-comment-prefix-regexp.

2004-08-20  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	  Moved the "Commands" chapter to near the start of the file.
	  Moved "Other Electric Commands" into the "Commands" chapter.
	  Split "Text Filling and Line Breaking" into the "Filling and Line
	Breaking Commands" (a section under "Commands"), and "Customizing Filling
	and Line Breaking".

2004-08-18  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Update the master menu for the file.

	* cc-mode.texi:
	  This change is the first stage in the restructuring of cc-mode.texi.
	  Added new chapter, "Configuration Strategies", and converted "Hooks" and
	"Styles" (together with the latter's sub-nodes) into sections of this new
	chapter.
	  Converted "Syntactic Symbols" and "Customizing Indentation" (together with
	the latter's sub-nodes "Interactive C.." and "Permanent C..") into sections of
	"Indentation Engine".  "Customizing Indentation" has acquired "Line-Up
	Functions", "Custom Line-up Functions" and "Other Special Indentations" as
	sub-nodes, but has lost "Hooks" and "Styles").
	  "Advanced Customization", formerly a sub-node of "Customizing Indentation"
	is now a chapter in its own right.  It has lost "Custom Line-Up Functions" and
	"Other Indentations".

2004-06-29  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Added flag to avoid
	heuristics that doesn't work for unclosed blocks.

	(c-at-statement-start-p): New function.

2004-06-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Added an FAQ item about the
	open-paren-in-column-zero issue.

2004-05-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el, cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): Moved from cc-vars to
	cc-defs for dependency reasons.  Fixed the POSIX char class test
	to check that it works in `skip-chars-(forward|backward)' too.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-arglist): Fixed bug when the first
	argument starts with a special brace list.

2004-05-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-type): Fixed promotion bug when
	`c-opt-type-concat-key' is used
	(i.e. in Pike).

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-special-brace-list): Fixed bug when
	the inner char pair doesn't have paren syntax, i.e. "(< >)".

2004-04-28  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	Amend doc(-strings) to say that <TAB> doesn't insert WS into a CPP
	line.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-vars.el (c-indent-command, c-tab-always-indent):
	Amend doc strings.

	* cc-mode.texi (@node Indentation Commands): Amend documentation
	of c-tab-always-indent.

2004-04-20  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-multi-inher): Made it syntactic whitespace
	safe.

2004-04-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el: Fixes in handling of Objective-C
	directives, e.g. directives spanning lines should work reasonably
	well now.

	(c-put-c-type-property, c-clear-c-type-property): New helpers.

	(c-forward-objc-directive): New function to move over any ObjC
	directive.

	(c-just-after-func-arglist-p, c-guess-basic-syntax,
	c-basic-matchers-before): Use it.

	(c-font-lock-objc-iip-decl): Removed.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Some improvement in the
	template arglist recognition.

2004-04-17  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): Fixed several inconsistencies in
	the Whitesmith style.

	* cc-mode.texi: Documented c-lineup-after-whitesmith-blocks.  Some
	other fixes.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-after-whitesmith-blocks): New lineup
	function to get lines after Whitesmith style blocks correctly
	indented.

	(c-lineup-whitesmith-in-block): Backed out the compensation for
	opening parens since it's done using `add' lists in the style
	definition instead.  Don't use the anchor position since it varies
	too much between the syntactic symbols. :P

	* cc-vars.el (c-valid-offset): Updated.

	* cc-mode.texi: Updated the doc for offset specifications on
	`c-offsets-alist'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-evaluate-offset): Extended to handle lists where
	the offsets are combined according to several different methods:
	`first', `min', `max', and `add'.  Report offset evaluation errors
	with `c-benign-error' so that some kind of reindentation still is
	done.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Anchor `arglist-intro' the
	same way as `arglist-cont-nonempty' and `arglist-close'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed similar situations
	for `arglist-cont-nonempty' and `arglist-close'.

2004-04-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed anchor position for
	`arglist-intro' when there are two arglist open parens on the same
	line and there's nothing in front of the first.

	* cc-mode.texi: Updated the parts dealing with line-up functions.
	Fixed some terminology to use the same words everywhere.

	* cc-langs.el (c-opt-identifier-concat-key-depth): New constant.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-basic-matchers-before): Fixed font locking of
	qualified names in Java, which previously could fontify common
	indexing expressions in many cases.  The standard Java naming
	conventions are used to tell them apart.

2004-04-12  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el: Use `cc-bytecomp-fboundp' and cc-bytecomp-boundp' in
	a number of places.

2004-04-09  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-whitesmith-in-block): Fixed inconsistency
	wrt opening parens on the first line inside a paren block.

	* cc-defs.el (c-langs-are-parametric): Made it known at compile
	time to avoid warnings.

	* cc-defs.el (c-langs-are-parametric): Must be known at compile
	time for the sake of `c-major-mode-is'.

	(c-mode-is-new-awk-p): Made it a macro to delay expansion of
	`c-major-mode-is' in the event that this is used inside a
	`c-lang-defconst'.

2004-04-04  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Fixed a macro related
	issue.

2004-04-03  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-awk.el: Remove (nearly all of) the
	cruft associated with AWK Mode's former concept of "virtual
	semicolons".

	* cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el, cc-engine.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-awk.el:
	1. Add character classes (e.g. "[:alpha:]") into AWK Mode's regexps.
	2. Adapt c-beginning-of-statement, c-end-of-statement (together with
	   subfunctions) to use the new notion of "virtual semicolon" in place of the
	   old awkward special handling for AWK.  There remains much cruft in
	   cc-awk.el, cc-cmds.el and cc-engine.el to clear out.

	* cc-awk.el: Change the terminology of regexps:  A char list is now [asdf],
	  a char class [:alpha:].  Include code for char classes.
	  Set c-awk-NL-prop on lines ending in open strings.  (Bug fix.)

	* cc-cmds.el:
	(c-ascertain-adjacent-literal): In the backwards direction, now
	recognises AWK regexp delimiters as string delimiters.
	(c-after-statement-terminator-p): Adapt for virtual semicolons;
	check more rigorously for "end of macro".
	(c-back-over-illiterals, c-forward-over-illiterals): Adapt for
	virtual semicolons;
	(c-beginning-of-statement): Adapt for virtual semicolons; Separate
	out the code for forward movement into ...
	(c-end-of-statement): Now contains the code for forward movement,
	adapted for virtual semicolons.

	* cc-engine.el:
	(c-ws*-string-limit-regexp): new regexp.
	(c-forward-single-comment, c-backward-single-comment): Comment out
	the (now redundant) "special" AWK stuff.

	* cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el: Change the settings of
	c-string-par-start, c-string-par-separate to be more like Text
	Mode than Fundamental Mode.

2004-03-27  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-styles.el:
	Add in two checks for user errors, thus eliminating cryptic and unhelpful
	  Emacs error messages. (1) Check the arg to `c-set-style' is a string.
	  (2) Check that settings to `c-offsets-alist' are not spuriously quoted.

2004-03-26  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Synchronise with the 5.31 latest version, 5.197,
	in particular enhancing the documentation of `c-add-style'.

2004-03-26  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Enhanced the style doc somewhat more.

2004-03-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-major-mode-is): Fixed expansion inside
	`c-lang-defconst' so that it works better with fallback languages.

	* cc-defs.el (c-add-language): Fixed a typo that caused it to fail
	to record the base mode.

2004-03-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Always narrow to the
	fontified region so that fontification doesn't occur outside it
	(could happen e.g. when fontifying a line with an unfinished
	declaration).

2004-03-18  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Fixed bug so that
	it doesn't go past the closing paren when PAREN-LEVEL is used.
	Reordered the syntax checks to get more efficient skipping in some
	situations.

2004-03-18  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-awk.el, cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el:
	Amend the concept of "virtual semicolons" (in the indentation engine) for
	languages like AWK, such that they are now conceptually attached to end of the
	last token of a statement, not the end of the line.  (In AWK Mode, however,
	the pertinent text property is still physically set on the EOL.)  Remove the
	specific tests for awk-mode, thus facilitating the introduction of other
	language modes where EOLs can end statements.  (Note: The funtionality in
	cc-cmds.el, specifically c-beginning/end-of-statement has yet to be amended.)

	* cc-awk.el:  Regexps for analysing AWK code have been moved to near the start
	  of the file.  ^L now separate sections of the file.
	  New defconsts: c-awk-non-eol-esc-pair-re,
	  c-awk-blank-or-comment-line-re, c-awk-one-line-possibly-open-string-re,
	  c-awk-regexp-one-line-possibly-open-char-class-re,
	  c-awk-one-line-possibly-open-regexp-re, c-awk-one-line-non-syn-ws*-re.
	  New functions: c-awk-at-vsemi-p, c-awk-vsemi-status-unknown-p.
	* cc-defs.el:  New macros c-at-vsemi-p, c-vsemi-status-unknown-p.

	* cc-langs.el:  Added `#' into AWK Mode's value of c-stmt-delim-chars.  New
	  c-lang-defvars: c-at-vsemi-p-fn, c-vsemi-status-unknown-p-fn (in a new
	  page).

	* cc-engine.el:  In c-beginning-of-statement-1, c-crosses-statement-barrier-p,
	  c-guess-basic-syntax, replace numerous awkward forms like
	  (if (c-major-mode-is 'awk-mode) (c-awk-prev-line-incomplete-p)) with
	  (c-at-vsemi-p).  Fix a few typos.  In c-guess-basic-syntax, new variable
	  before-ws-ip, the place just after char-before-ip appears.

	* cc-mode.el:  Fix what's almost a semantic ambiguity in a comment.

2004-03-02  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Cleaned up using
	`c-tentative-buffer-changes'.

	* cc-defs.el (c-region-is-active-p): Simplified and converted to
	macro to choose between Emacs and XEmacs at compile time.

	(c-set-region-active): New set counterpart to
	`c-region-is-active-p'.

	(c-tentative-buffer-changes): New macro to handle temporary buffer
	changes in a convenient way.

	(c-tnt-chng-record-state, c-tnt-chng-cleanup): Internal helpers
	for `c-tentative-buffer-changes'.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Don't trip up on a line
	continuation which might precede the newly inserted '{'.

2004-03-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Fixed cases where
	it could loop indefinitely.

2004-02-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Tightened up the
	checks for paren sexps between the point and the keyword, to avoid
	some false alarms.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Fixed a
	situation where an error could be thrown for unbalanced parens.
	Changed to make use of c-keyword-member' to avoid some repeated
	regexp matches.

	(c-opt-lambda-key, c-opt-inexpr-block-key,
	c-opt-inexpr-class-key): These language variable are no longer
	necessary.

	(c-block-stmt-kwds): New language constant used by
	c-looking-at-inexpr-block'.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Removed an optional check that looked at
	the existence of the now removed language variables.

	* cc-engine.el (c-fdoc-shift-type-backward,
	c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Fixed invalid recognition of C++ style
	object instantiation expressions as declarations in some contexts.
	This bug only affected languages where the declarator can't be
	enclosed in parentheses.

2004-02-21  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi (c-block-comment-prefix): State that it's default
	setting, "* " gets overridden by the default style, gnu.

2004-02-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): Fixed the GNU style to insert
	newlines before and after substatement braces.

2004-02-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el: Improved the heuristics for recognizing function
	declaration headers and the handling of C++ style member init
	lists.

	(c-just-after-func-arglist-p): Rewritten to use
	`c-forward-decl-or-cast-1'.  Now behaves a bit differently too.

	(c-beginning-of-member-init-list): Removed since it isn't used
	anymore.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Case 5B adapted for the new
	`c-just-after-func-arglist-p'.  Cases 5B.1 and 5B.3 merged.  Cases
	5D.1 and 5D.2 removed since they aren't trigged anymore (case 5B.1
	covers all cases now).

	* cc-defs.el (c-point): Added 'bosws and 'eosws.

2004-02-15  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el: Correct silly bug in previous commit.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el:
	New variables c-string-par-start/separate c-sentence-end-with-esc-eol,
	  initialised in c-setup-paragraph-variables, used in string scanning
	  subroutines of c-beginning-of-statement.

2004-02-06  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): don't delete a comment which
	precedes the newly inserted `{'.

2003-12-08  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarators): Handle array size specs
	correctly.  Only fontify identifiers in front of '(' with as
	functions - don't accept any paren char.  Tightened up initializer
	skipping to stop before function and class blocks.

2003-12-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el: Rewrote the recognition function for
	declaration level blocks.  It should now cope with templates
	better and also be a lot more comprehensible.

	(c-looking-at-decl-block): The new function.

	(c-search-uplist-for-classkey): The old one.  It's now a wrapper
	for compatibility.

	(c-add-class-syntax, c-guess-continued-construct,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Adapted for `c-looking-at-decl-block'.

	(c-decl-block-key): Changed to tell apart ambiguous and
	unambiguous keywords.  Pike specials are now handled directly in
	the code instead.

	(c-block-prefix-disallowed-chars, c-block-prefix-charset): New
	language constants and variables to make the backward skip in
	`c-looking-at-decl-block' as tight as possible.

	(c-nonsymbol-token-char-list): New language constant.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-<>-arglist): New function to find
	balanced template arglists backwards.

	* cc-defs.el (c-make-bare-char-alt): New helper for making char
	classes for `c-syntactic-skip-backward'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Simplified case 16D - can't
	be a class-close at that point.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax, c-add-class-syntax): Don't
	narrow out the enclosing declaration level.  This makes everything
	a lot easier, and it was actually only four small places that
	needed it to work.  Some places that previously did `widen' are
	removed now, which has the effect that `c-guess-basic-syntax'
	never will look at things outside the current narrowment now.  The
	anchor position for `topmost-intro' is affected by this, but it
	was so bogus it was basically useless before, and now it's equally
	bogus but in a slightly different way.

	(c-narrow-out-enclosing-class): Gone.

	(c-most-enclosing-brace, c-least-enclosing-brace): Don't filter to
	the narrowed region.

	(c-least-enclosing-brace): Removed silly optional argument.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-decl-1): Fixed bug where the point
	could be left directly after an open paren when finding the
	beginning of the first decl in the block.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state): Don't use the syntax table when
	filtering out legitimate open parens to be recorded.  This could
	cause cache inconsistencies when e.g. `c++-template-syntax-table'
	was temporarily in use.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-decl-1): Fixed bug where the point
	could be left directly after an open paren when finding the
	beginning of the first decl in the block.

2003-12-06  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el (c-forward-keyword-clause): Specify
	which submatch to use.

	* cc-langs.el (c-symbol-start): Include '@' in ObjC.

	(c-decl-start-re): No no longer any need for special treatment of
	ObjC due to the above.

	(c-other-block-decl-kwds): Handle "extern" in ObjC too since it
	presumably follows C in that regard.

	* cc-langs.el (c-identifier-ops, c-after-id-concat-ops): New
	language constants to specify operator tokens inside identifiers
	in a more high level way.

	(c-opt-identifier-prefix-key): New internal language constant.

	(c-opt-identifier-concat-key, c-opt-after-id-concat-key,
	c-identifier-start, c-identifier-key): Now completely calculated
	from other constants.

	(c-identifier-last-sym-match): Decommissioned since it's no longer
	used.

	(c-operators): Use `c-identifier-ops'.  Documented
	`postfix-if-paren'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-name): Removed the optimization when
	c-identifier-key is equal to c-symbol-key since it doesn't work in
	byte compiled files.  Don't record empty regions as identifiers.

	* cc-langs.el (c-filter-ops): New helper function to simplify
	access to `c-operators' and its likes.

	(c-operator-list, c-all-op-syntax-tokens,
	c-nonsymbol-token-regexp, c-<>-multichar-token-regexp,
	c-<-op-cont-regexp, c->-op-cont-regexp, c-expr-kwds,
	c-primary-expr-regexp, c-cast-parens): Use it.

	* cc-defs.el (c-lang-const): Fixes to allow use without an
	explicit language in functions.

	* cc-defs.el (c-make-keywords-re): Added an appendable variant of
	adornment.

2003-12-05  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-any-class-key): Removed unused language variable.

	(c-type-decl-prefix-key): Removed some now unnecessary cruft from
	the Pike value.

	* cc-engine.el (c-on-identifier, c-simple-skip-symbol-backward):
	Small fix for handling "-" correctly in `skip-chars-backward'.
	Affected the operator lfun syntax in Pike.

	(c-forward-label): Small fix for handling "-" correctly in
	`c-syntactic-skip-backward'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-on-identifier, c-simple-skip-symbol-backward):
	Small fix for handling "-" correctly in `skip-chars-backward'.
	Affected the operator lfun syntax in Pike.

2003-12-04  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-make-init-lang-vars-fun): Disabled the diagnostic
	message about precompiled language vars not being used.

	* cc-langs.el (c-paren-nontype-kwds): The GCC keyword
	"__attribute__" is followed by a parenthesis.

	(c-type-start-kwds, c-prefix-spec-kwds, c-prefix-spec-kwds-re,
	c-specifier-key, c-not-decl-init-keywords): Some cleanup using new
	language constants `c-type-start-kwds' and `c-prefix-spec-kwds'.

2003-11-30  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-invalidate-sws-region-after): Fixed bug that
	could cause an error from `after-change-functions' when the
	changed region is at bob.

	* cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el, cc-engine.el: Internal cleanups to
	properly detect the declared identifiers in various declarations.

	(c-decl-start-kwds): New language constant to recognize
	declarations that can start anywhere.  Used for class declarations
	in Pike.

	(c-specifier-key, c-not-decl-init-keywords,
	c-decl-prefix-or-start-re, c-find-decl-prefix-search,
	c-find-decl-spots): Implement `c-decl-start-kwds'.

	(c-other-decl-kwds, c-postfix-decl-spec-kwds, c-decl-hangon-kwds,
	c-decl-hangon-key, c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Separated the
	handling of the compiler specific extension keywords into a new
	language constant `c-decl-hangon-kwds' that defines keyword
	clauses to be ignored in declarations.

	(c-forward-id-comma-list, c-forward-keyword-clause): Don't skip
	past unrecognized tokens when handling `c-colon-type-list-kwds'.
	Necessary to stop at the declared identifier in e.g. IDL valuetype
	declarations.

	(c-typedef-decl-kwds, c-typeless-decl-kwds, c-type-list-kwds,
	c-prefix-spec-kwds-re, c-postfix-spec-kwds,
	c-after-suffixed-type-decl-key, c-opt-postfix-decl-spec-key,
	c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Recognize the declared identifier in
	class and enum declarations as such and not as part of the type.

	(c-forward-decl-or-cast-1, c-forward-label): Relaxed the
	interpretation of PRECEDING-TOKEN-END when there's no preceding
	token.

	(c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Don't disregard sure signs of
	declarations when there's some syntax error later on.

	(c-complex-decl-matchers): Did away with a reference to
	`c-specifier-key'.

2003-11-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-maybe-labelp): Provide no default value - this
	variable is always dynamically bound.

2003-11-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el, cc-menus.el, cc-mode.el,
	cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el, cc-align.el, cc-awk.el, cc-cmds.el,
	cc-defs.el: Changed the policy for marking up functions that might
	do hidden buffer changes: All such internal functions are now
	marked instead of those that don't.

	(c-beginning-of-macro, c-end-of-macro, c-(forward|backward)-comments,
	c-(forward|backward)-single-comment, c-parse-state, c-on-identifier,
	c-(fast-|slow-|)in-literal, c-literal-limits, c-collect-line-comments,
	c-literal-type): Allow these functions to make hidden buffer changes,
	so that they are free to use text property caching later on.

	(c-electric-backspace, c-electric-delete-forward, c-electric-pound,
	c-electric-brace, c-electric-slash, c-electric-star,
	c-electric-semi&comma, c-electric-colon, c-electric-lt-gt,
	c-electric-paren, c-electric-continued-statement, c-indent-command,
	c-indent-region, c-mask-paragraph, c-indent-new-comment-line,
	c-context-line-break): Added `c-save-buffer-state' calls to comply
	with the changed semantics of the functions above.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	Fixed a bug when macros occur in obscure
	places.  Optimized the sexp movement a bit.

2003-11-21  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-awk.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-mode.el, cc-mode.texi:
	Enhancements for c-beginning-of-statement to work in AWK Mode:
	cc-awk.el:
	  Supersede c-awk-NL-prop value `;' (completed statement) with `}' (statement
	    completed by closing brace or semicolon) and `$' (statement completed by
	    EOL).
	  New functions: c-awk-virtual-semicolon-ends-prev-line-p,
	    c-awk-virtual-semicolon-ends-line-p, c-awk-skip-semantic-ws-forward,
	    c-awk-skip-semantic-ws-backward, c-awk-at-statement-end-p.
	cc-cmds.el:
	  Simplify the structure of functions c-forward-over-illiterals,
	    c-back-over-illiterals.
	  Enhance these two functions and c-beginning-of-statement to handle AWK Mode.
	cc-engine.el:
	  Enhance c-forward-single-comment, c-backward-single-comment for AWK mode.
	    Attempt to clarify their doc-strings.
	cc-mode.el:
	  Put M-a and M-e into awk-mode-map.
	cc-mode.texi:
	  Document that M-a and M-e now work in AWK mode.  Fix minor typos.

2003-11-21  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el: Cleaned up the label
	handling.  Labels are now recognized in a uniform and more robust
	way, regardless of context.  Text properties are put on all labels
	to recognize the following declarations better.  Multiword labels
	are handled both in indentation and fontification for the benefit
	of language extensions like Qt.  For consistency, keywords in
	labels are now fontified with the label face instead.  That also
	applies to "case" and "default".

	(c-beginning-of-statement-1): Fixed some bugs in the label
	handling.  Disregard `c-nonlabel-token-key' in labels that begin
	with `c-label-kwds'.

	(c-find-decl-spots): Support that the callback adds more
	`c-decl-end' spots to find.

	(c-forward-decl-or-cast-1): Don't treat a list of plain
	identifiers followed by a colon as a declaration.

	(c-forward-label): New function to recognize labels.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Replaced uses of `c-label-key' with
	`c-forward-label'.  Moved the label recognition cases (14 and 15)
	earlier since they aren't so context sensitive now.  Handle labels
	on the top level gracefully.  Moved access label recognition to
	the generic label case (CASE 15) - removed CASE 5E.

	(c-font-lock-declarations): Added recognition of labels in the
	same round since we need to handle labels in parallell with other
	declarations to recognize both accurately.  It should also improve
	speed.

	(c-simple-decl-matchers, c-basic-matchers-after): Moved
	`c-font-lock-labels' so that it only is used on decoration level 2
	since `c-font-lock-declarations' handles it otherwise.

	(c-complex-decl-matchers): Removed the simplistic recognition of
	access labels.

	(c-decl-prefix-re): Removed the kludges that was necessary to cope
	with labels earlier.

	(c-decl-start-re): New language variable to make
	`c-font-lock-declarations' stop for the special protection labels
	in Objective-C that start with '@'.

	(c-label-key): Removed since it's no longer used.

	(c-recognize-colon-labels, c-label-prefix-re): New language
	constants to support recognition of generic colon-terminated
	labels.

	(c-type-decl-end-used): `c-decl-end' is now used whenever there
	are colon terminated labels.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-arglist): Fixed bug when the first
	argument starts with a special brace list.

2003-11-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el (c-forward-decl-or-cast-1,
	c-font-lock-declarations): Broke out the declaration and cast
	recognition from `c-font-lock-declarations' to a new function, so
	that it can be used in the indentation engine.

2003-11-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-continued-construct,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Check a little more carefully if it's an
	function declaration when an unknown construct followed by a block
	is found inside a statement context.  This avoids macros followed
	by blocks to be taken as function declarations.

	(c-guess-continued-construct): Changed the analysis of a statement
	continuation with a brace open to `substatement-block', for
	consistency with recognized statements.

	(c-add-stmt-syntax): Don't continue to the surrounding sexp if the
	start is in a position so that `c-beginning-of-statement-1' jumped
	to the beginning of the same statement.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-continued-construct,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Check a little more carefully if it's an
	function declaration when an unknown construct followed by a block
	is found inside a statement context.  This avoids macros followed
	by blocks to be taken as function declarations.

	(c-guess-continued-construct): Changed the analysis of a statement
	continuation with a brace open to `substatement-block', for
	consistency with recognized statements.

2003-11-15  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el
	(c-forward-<>-arglist-recur): Don't accept binary operators in the
	arglist if we're in a function call context, i.e. if
	`c-restricted-<>-arglists' is set.  That avoids template
	recognition in cases like "if (a < b || c > d)".

	(c-restricted-<>-arglists): New more appropriate name for
	`c-disallow-comma-in-<>-arglists'.

	Accessing functions updated for the variable name change.

2003-11-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-find-decl-spots): Fixed bug in backing up to the
	start of the literal.  Fixed bug with the point on the wrong side
	of the search limit that could happen when the start position is
	inside a literal.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state, c-invalidate-state-cache): Modified
	the use of `c-state-cache-end' so that it's kept a little bit back
	to increase the hit rate.

	(c-parse-state): Changed the macro handling and fixed some
	glitches.  Macro context is checked more often than necessary now,
	but otoh less garbage conses are generated.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state, c-invalidate-state-cache): Cache
	the last position where `c-state-cache' applies.  This can speed
	up refontification quite a bit in blocks where there are many
	non-brace parens before the point.

	(c-state-cache-end): New variable for this.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax, c-debug-parse-state): Adapted for the new
	cache variable.

2003-11-06  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-find-decl-spots): Take more care to get close
	initial continue positions when the start position is inside a
	literal or macro.  Do not call the callback for spots before the
	start position (which can happen e.g. for `c-decl-end' spots
	inside comments).  Optimize better in special cases when the
	region is a single line inside a literal or macro (typically when
	the current line is refontified).

2003-11-04  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Fix bug where the
	match data could get clobbered if NOT-INSIDE-TOKEN is used.

2003-11-02  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Simplified calls to
	`c-add-stmt-syntax' - there's no need to explicitly whack off
	entries from the paren state.

	* cc-engine.el (c-add-stmt-syntax): Narrowed down the special case
	for "else if" clauses.

2003-11-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block, c-add-stmt-syntax): Use
	`c-recognize-paren-inexpr-blocks'.

	* cc-langs.el (c-recognize-paren-inexpr-blocks): New language
	variable to recognize the gcc extension with statement blocks
	inside expressions.

	* cc-engine.el (c-add-stmt-syntax): Restructured to make it
	somewhat more comprehensible.  The argument AT-BLOCK-START is no
	longer used and hence removed.

	(c-guess-continued-construct, c-guess-basic-syntax): Updated calls
	to `c-add-stmt-syntax'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Don't allow parens in
	labels.

	(c-backward-to-decl-anchor): Use `c-beginning-of-statement-1'
	instead of duplicating parts of it.  This fixes bogus label
	recognition.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-to-decl-anchor): Use
	`c-beginning-of-statement-1' instead of duplicating parts of it.
	This fixes bogus label recognition.

	* cc-mode.texi: Extended the doc on c-label-minimum-indentation a
	little.

	* cc-align.el (c-gnu-impose-minimum): Reverted to the old method
	of checking the context in which to apply the minimum indentation,
	so that it isn't enforced in e.g.  namespace blocks.

	* cc-vars.el (c-inside-block-syms): New constant used by
	`c-gnu-impose-minimum'.  It's defined close to `c-offsets-alist'
	to somewhat reduce the risk of becoming stale.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el (c-shift-line-indentation): Moved from
	cc-cmds to cc-engine to allow use from cc-align.

2003-10-29  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-inheritance-list): Cope with fully
	qualified identifiers containing "::".
q
2003-10-26  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-add-type, c-check-type, c-forward-name,
	c-forward-type): Improved storage of template types in
	`c-found-types' so that they can be recognized better.

	(c-syntactic-content): Added option to skip past nested parens.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-name): Set `c-last-identifier-range' all
	the time.  It's less work that way.  Handle that there might not
	be an identifier to store in `c-last-identifier-range'.

	(c-forward-type): Handle that `c-last-identifier-range' might be
	nil from `c-forward-name'.

	* cc-defs.el: (c-safe-scan-lists,
	c-(go-)?(up|down)-list-(forward|backward)): Added limit arguments.

	* cc-defs.el (c-save-buffer-state): Use `unwind-protect' to work
	even if the form fails.

	* cc-defs.el (c-make-keywords-re): Added kludge for bug in
	`regexp-opt' in Emacs 20 and XEmacs when strings contain newlines.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state): Speedup when moving far down in a
	large file in one go.

	(c-get-fallback-start-pos): New helper function for
	`c-parse-state'.

2003-10-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): Use a space in front of the name
	of the temporary buffer.  That also avoids dumping problems in
	XEmacs due to undo info being left around after the buffer is
	killed.

	* cc-mode.texi: Document c-lineup-assignments and c-lineup-math.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-assignments): New lineup function which is
	like `c-lineup-math' but returns nil instead of `c-basic-offset'
	when it doesn't match.

	(c-lineup-math): Changed to use `c-lineup-assignments'.

2003-10-20  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: Fix some bugs in subfunctions of

2003-10-14  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el: Use `c-simple-ws' instead of hardcoded
	char classes whereever possible.  Changed a couple of places to
	use skip by syntax instead of skip by char class.

	* cc-langs.el (c-unterminated-block-comment-regexp): Fixed a bug
	in the regexp that caused extreme backtracking.

2003-10-13  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-in-knr-argdecl): Look closer at the function
	arglist to see if it's a K&R style declaration.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5B.2: Check with `c-in-knr-argdecl'
	before returning knr-argdecl-intro.

2003-10-12  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-block-comment-starter, c-block-comment-ender):
	New language constants to specify in a single place how block
	comments look.

	(c-comment-start-regexp, c-block-comment-start-regexp,
	comment-start, comment-end, comment-start-skip,
	c-syntactic-ws-start, c-syntactic-ws-end, c-nonwhite-syntactic-ws,
	c-syntactic-ws, c-nonempty-syntactic-ws,
	c-single-line-syntactic-ws, c-syntactic-eol): Now built from
	`c-line-comment-starter', `c-block-comment-starter' and
	`c-block-comment-ender'.

	(c-block-comment-regexp, c-unterminated-block-comment-regexp): New
	language constants to break up things a bit.

	(c-simple-ws): New language constant for simple whitespace.

	* cc-defs.el (c-concat-separated): New convenience function.

	* cc-defs.el (c-make-keywords-re): Added kludge for bug in
	`regexp-opt' in Emacs 20 and XEmacs when strings contain newlines.
	Allow and ignore nil elements in the list.

2003-10-06  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: Comment out a (n almost certainly superfluous)
	check, (eq here (point-max)) in c-beginning-of-statement.

2003-10-02  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: Tidy up the comments in c-beginning-of-statement and
	subfunctions.

2003-10-01  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-awk.el: Replace calls to put-text-property to the more
	flexible c-put-char-property and c-clear-char-properties.  Add the
	author's email address.

2003-09-30  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el: New variable, c-block-comment-start-regexp.

2003-09-29  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: 1. Fix stupid error in previous commit.  2. Fix bug
	with M-e, when point is inside the closing "*/" of a block
	comment.

	* cc-cmds.el: Tidy c-beginning-of-sentence (and subfunctions) so
	that it works at BOB and EOB.

	* cc-cmds.el: Correct small inaccuracy in previous check-in.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-vars.el: More updating of
	c-beginning-of-statement, including new variable
	c-block-comment-start-regexp.

2003-09-24  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state): Fixed bug that could cause errors
	when the state cache contains info on parts that have been
	narrowed out.

2003-09-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi, cc-vars.el (c-comment-prefix-regexp): Document
	that `c-setup-paragraph-variables' has to be used when this
	variable is changed; it doesn't work to reinitialize the mode
	since that typically clobbers the variable.

	* cc-styles.el (c-setup-paragraph-variables): Made it interactive.

2003-09-21  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-known-type-key): Optimize simple symbols from
	`*-font-lock-extra-types' so that there's no need to use
	`regexp-opt' on those lists.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Fixed recognition of
	constructors and destructors for classes whose names are matched
	by `*-font-lock-extra-types'.

	* cc-langs.el (c-type-list-kwds): If "operator" is followed by an
	identifier in C++ then it's a type.

	* cc-langs.el (c-type-decl-suffix-key): Fix when
	`c-type-modifier-kwds' is empty.

2003-09-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-invalid-string): Fix when there are
	several strings on the same line.

	* cc-engine.el (c-literal-limits): Removed the compatibility
	function for older emacsen.  `c-literal-limits-fast' has now taken
	the place of this function.

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): Removed compatibility with older
	emacsen: We now require 'pps-extended-state.

2003-09-17  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-invalid-string): Fixed eob problem that
	primarily affected XEmacs.  Don't use faces to find unterminated
	strings since Emacs and XEmacs fontify strings differently - this
	function should now work better in XEmacs.

2003-09-15  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: New function c-beginning-of-sentence, which obviates
	the need to hack sentence-end.  This now handles escaped newlines
	in strings correctly.  Correct minor bugs in c-move-over-sentence
	and in c-beginning-of-statement.

2003-09-13  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement (and subfunctions)): Adapt
	c-\(back\|forward\)-over-illiterals such that movement over macros
	and code are rigorously separated from eachother.  Correct a few
	incidental bugs.

2003-09-08  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Fixed a bug in the
	`expand-abbrev' workaround which caused braces to disbehave inside
	macros.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-keyword-clause): Fixed error handling.
	This bug could cause interactive font locking to bail out.

2003-08-31  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-just-after-func-arglist-p): Handle paren-style
	types in Pike.  Also fixed some cases of insufficient handling of
	unbalanced parens.

2003-08-29  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: Restructure c-beginning-of-statement: Improve its
	doc-string.  Improve the handling of certain specific cases.

2003-08-26  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Work around for a misfeature in

	contain essentially any symbols.

	(c-opt-extra-label-key): New language variable to cope with the
	special protection label syntax in Objective-C.

	(c-opt-access-key): Removed; this is now handled better by
	`c-nonlabel-token-key' and `c-opt-extra-label-key'.

	(c-complex-decl-matchers): Update to handle that
	`c-opt-access-key' no longer exists.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Make use of the improved
	label recognition in `c-beginning-of-statement-1'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-member-init-list): Recognize
	bitfields better.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-inheritance-list): Removed some
	cruft and fixed a bug that could cause it to go to a position
	further down.

	* cc-langs.el, cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Improved
	detection of labels in declaration contexts.

	(c-beginning-of-decl-1): Use it.

	(c-nonlabel-token-key): New language constant and variable needed
	by `c-beginning-of-statement-1'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug that manifested
	itself due to the correction in `c-forward-sexp'.

	* cc-defs.el (c-forward-sexp, c-backward-sexp): Made these behave
	as documented when used at the buffer limits.

	* cc-mode.el, cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-type-decl-end-used):
	Made this a language variable.

	* cc-mode.el (c-after-change): Widen the buffer to work correctly
	when `combine-after-change-calls' is used together with temporary
	narrowings.

2003-08-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Report labels
	correctly when the start point is immediately after the colon.

2003-08-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-extra-types-widget): The doc string is mandatory
	in `define-widget'.

	* cc-align.el, cc-langs.el (c-lineup-math): Don't align the
	operators "!=", "<=" and ">=" as assignment operators.

	(c-assignment-operators): New language constant that only contains
	the assignment operators.

	(c-assignment-op-regexp): New language variable used by
	`c-lineup-math'.

	isn't used anymore.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-lt-gt): Detect and mark angle bracket
	arglists such as template parens in C++.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-skip-backward): Fixed a bug in the
	last check-in.  Some optimization.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-skip-backward): Fixed bug where it
	could stop at the same level in a preceding sexp when PAREN-LEVEL
	is set.

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): Turn on syntax-table text
	property lookup only when it's needed.

	* cc-langs.el, cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-mode.el: Changed the
	policy for paren marked angle brackets to be more persistent; once
	marked they remain marked even when they're found to be unbalanced
	in the searched region.  This should keep the paren syntax around
	even when individual lines are refontified in multiline template
	arglists.

	(c-parse-and-markup-<>-arglists): New dynamically bound variable
	to control markup so that incorrect angle bracket arglists aren't
	marked in contexts where the correct value for
	`c-disallow-comma-in-<>-arglists' isn't known.

	(c-forward-<>-arglist, c-forward-<>-arglist-recur): The reparse
	argument has become `c-parse-and-markup-<>-arglists'.

	(c-remove-<>-arglist-properties): Removed - no longer used.

	(c-after-change-check-<>-operators): New function used on
	`after-change-functions' to avoid that "<" and ">" characters that
	are part of longer operators have paren syntax.

	(c-<>-multichar-token-regexp): New language variable used by
	`c-after-change-check-<>-operators'.

	(c-after-change): Call `c-after-change-check-<>-operators'.

	(c-font-lock-<>-arglists): Use the context properties set by
	`c-font-lock-declarations' to set
	`c-disallow-comma-in-<>-arglists' correctly to avoid doing invalid
	markup.

	(c-font-lock-declarations): Removed code that undoes the invalid
	markup done by `c-font-lock-<>-arglists'.

	(c-complex-decl-matchers): `c-font-lock-<>-arglists' now runs
	after `c-font-lock-declarations'.

2003-08-08  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	feature.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Improved the anchor position for
	`template-args-cont' in nested template arglists.  There's still
	much to be desired in this area, though.

2003-08-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-just-after-func-arglist-p): Safeguard against
	unbalanced sexps.

2003-08-03  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-init-language-vars-for): Add argument MODE.
	Renamed from c-init-c-language-vars'.
	(c-initialize-cc-mode): Change accordingly.
	(c-common-init): Ditto.
	(c-mode): Ditto.
	(c++-mode): Use function.
	(objc-mode): Ditto.
	(java-mode): Ditto.
	(idl-mode): Ditto.
	(pike-mode): Ditto.
	(awk-mode): Ditto.

2003-08-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-end-of-current-token): Return whether or not the
	point moved.

	(c-search-decl-header-end): Don't trip up on operator identifiers
	in C++ and operators like == in all languages.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-to-decl-anchor): Detect leading labels
	correctly.

2003-07-21  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el, cc-mode.texi, cc-vars.el:

	* cc-mode.texi: Some updates due to the dropping of the support
	for older emacsen.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el (c-mode-is-new-awk-p): Removed;
	(c-major-mode-is 'awk-mode) can be used instead now.

	* cc-mode.el: Always set up AWK mode since emacsen where it
	doesn't work no longer are supported.

	* cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el, cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el,
	cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el, cc-cmds.el: CC Mode now requires support
	for the syntax-table' text property, which rules out Emacs 19 and
	XEmacs < 21.4.  Removed various compatibility cruft associated
	with those versions.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-fix.el: CC Mode now requires support for the
	`syntax-table' text property, which rules out Emacs 19 and XEmacs
	< 21.4.  Removed various compatibility cruft associated with those
	versions.

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): CC Mode now requires support for
	the `syntax-table' text property.

2003-07-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-nonbreakable-space-face): Remove the variable and
	use an extra quoted face name instead.  All the emacsen flavors
	handle that correctly.

	* cc-defs.el (c-langelem-sym, c-langelem-pos, c-langelem-2nd-pos):
	Added accessor functions for syntactic elements.

2003-07-09  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	names to these language constants.

2003-07-08  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Do not do hidden buffer
	changes; there's third party code that calls this function
	directly.

2003-07-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (javadoc-font-lock-keywords,
	autodoc-font-lock-keywords): Don't byte compile on font lock
	initialization when running from byte compiled files.

2003-07-06  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el: Fix AWK mode indentation when previous statement
	ends with auto-increment "++".

2003-07-05  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el, cc-styles.el (c-style-alist, c-lang-variable-inits,
	c-lang-variable-inits-tail): The values of these are changed, so
	declare them as variables and not constants.

2003-07-05  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el, cc-styles.el (c-style-alist, c-lang-variable-inits,
	c-lang-variable-inits-tail): The values of these are changed, so
	declare them as variables and not constants.

	* cc-mode.el: Fixed some autoload problems: Try to ensure that the
	entry for ".c" extension comes before the one for ".C" on
	`auto-mode-alist', to behave better on case insensitive OS:es.
	Fixed incorrect entries that were added to
	`interpreter-mode-alist'.  Moved the autoload directives for AWK
	to the top level since they aren't recognized anywhere else.  Do
	not use the new AWK mode doc in the autoload form for the old AWK
	mode.

2003-07-03  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-complex-decl-prepare,
	c-font-lock-declarators, c-font-lock-declarations,

	refontification inside multiline declarations better.

2003-07-02  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Recognize a construct
	like "a * b = c;" as a declaration.

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-init): Do not set
	`imenu-create-index-function' if the second argument is left out.
	This bug broke the imenu support in C, C++ and Java modes.

2003-06-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Release 5.30.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-align.el (c-add-stmt-syntax, c-lineup-arglist,
	c-lineup-arglist-close-under-paren): Fixes to cope with special
	brace lists in Pike.

	c-awk-backward-syntactic-ws.

2003-06-17  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fix.el: cc-mode-19.el has been renamed to cc-fix.el since it
	now contains compatibility stuff for later versions than (X)Emacs
	19.

2003-06-17  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-paren-nontype-kwds): New language constant.

	(c-other-decl-kwds, c-postfix-decl-spec-kwds): Added compiler

	'__declspec'.

	`c-paren-nontype-kwds'.

2003-06-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-primary-expr-regexp): Don't match a bare period

	c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixes in handling of bitfields.

2003-06-13  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (comment-end): Put a space in front of the comment
	ender in C, as it was before the move from cc-mode.el.

2003-06-11  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el: Do not load cc-awk.elc or awk-font-lock-keywords
	unless there is an AWK Mode buffer.

2003-06-10  Alan Mackenzie  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-awk.el: New file that implements AWK support, superseding the
	old separate derived mode in awk-mode.el.

	* cc-vars.el, cc-mode-19.el, cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el, cc-defs.el,
	cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el: Changes for the new AWK support.

2003-06-05  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-decl-block-key,
	c-search-uplist-for-classkey): Check that the modifier is followed
	by "{" in Pike before considering it to start a class-like block.

2003-05-30  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-cc-mode): Added some compatibility to
	make this function behave somewhat more as documented for derived
	modes.  It's still not enough to make the old AWK mode behave
	reasonably, but it's been like this a long time now so fixing it
	more might cause trouble elsewhere. :P

2003-05-29  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-remove-font-lock-face): New macro to remove a
	font lock face properly (especially in XEmacs).

	* cc-bytecomp.el (cc-bytecomp-obsolete-fun): Added the same kludge
	as in `cc-bytecomp-obsolete-var' to avoid a confused compiler
	warning.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-type): Fixed a bug in the handling of
	concatenated types when the component types are known.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-constant-face-name): Added face name variable to
	avoid the use of `font-lock-constant-face' for constants in
	emacsen that doesn't have it.

2003-05-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el, cc-cmds.el: Fixes for the syntactic
	symbols for module and composition blocks.

2003-05-17  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): Use
	`open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' if it exists and works.

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): Added `col-0-paren' to detect
	when `open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' exists and actually
	works.

2003-05-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-argcont, c-lineup-gcc-asm-reg): Don't
	quote nil in docstrings.

2003-04-14  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el, cc-langs.el (c-primitive-type-kwds,
	c-font-lock-extra-types): "complex" and "imaginary" aren't
	keywords in C99, only macros that expand to the keywords
	"_Complex" and "_Imaginary", so make the former a bit less
	hardcoded by putting it on `c-font-lock-extra-types' instead.
	There are also "bool" and "_Bool" that work the same way.

	(c-constant-kwds): "false" and "true" are standard constant macros
	in C99.

2003-04-09  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-menus.el, cc-langs.el, cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-cmds.el:
	Fixed various regexps to use POSIX char classes when that is
	supported.

	* cc-defs.el (c-alpha, c-alnum, c-digit, c-upper, c-lower): New
	constants to make it easier to create regexps that use POSIX char
	classes in emacsen that support them.

2003-04-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): Detect in the regexp engine
	understands POSIX char classes.

2003-04-05  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-after-change): Added kludge for bug where this
	function sometimes gets positions outside the buffer range.

2003-03-30  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-member-init-list): Better handling
	of paretheses in unexpected places.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-<>-arglist-recur): Fixed a regexp match
	order problem that could cause empty template args on the form
	"<>" to be missed.

2003-03-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state): Added kludge to avoid an infinite
	loop when Emacs' open-paren-in-column-zero rule kicks in and
	causes the sexp functions to misbehave.

2003-03-06  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-member-init-list): Fixed bug when
	C++-like code is encountered in non-C++ mode.

2003-03-02  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-make-keywords-re): Added option to specify the
	language to look up `c-nonsymbol-key' in.

2003-02-24  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el (c-auto-newline-analysis): New
	dynamically bound variable to turn off the
	topmost-intro-cont/statement-cont kludge for brace lists during
	the analysis for the auto newline feature.  This fixes some cases
	where the setting for `brace-list-open' on
	`c-hanging-braces-alist' didn't have any effect.

2003-02-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-literal-start-regexp): Yet another language
	variable.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-doc-comments,
	c-find-invalid-doc-markup, javadoc-font-lock-keywords): Fixed
	fontification of the markup in Javadoc comments.

        * cc-engine.el: Fixes in face handling to cope with doc comments.

	(c-find-decl-spots): More failsafe skipping of comments and
	strings that only have been partially fontified.

	* cc-defs.el (c-got-face-at): New subst to test faces at positions
	easier.

	* cc-defs.el (c-safe-scan-lists): New wrapper macro to avoid the
	warnings with too many args to `scan-lists' in Emacs.

2003-02-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-skip-backward): New function to make
	syntactic searches in the backward direction easier.

	(c-beginning-of-statement-1): Optimized skipping over large paren
	sexps somewhat.

	(c-safe-position): Removed the odd macro handling which was
	centered around the point instead of the passed position.

2003-02-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-in-knr-argdecl): Do not trip up on
	initialization expressions.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-arglist, c-lineup-close-paren,
	c-lineup-arglist-close-under-paren): Tuned the "macro block"
	heuristics to work better in nested arglist situations.

2003-02-10  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-offset): Don't find a default syntactic
	element through syntactic analysis if called outside a CC Mode
	buffer.

2003-02-09  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): Install `c-fill-paragraph' on
	`fill-paragraph-function'.  Although it's not the normal way to
	call it in a CC Mode buffer it makes a direct call to
	`fill-paragraph' work better.

2003-01-28  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el, cc-mode.el (c-require-final-newline): Made this
	variable an alist to specify a value for each language.  The
	default value causes `require-final-newline' to be set to t only
	in languages where the standard requires a final newline.

2003-01-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el, cc-vars.el (c-require-final-newline): Added a
	variable to make the initialization of `require-final-newline'
	more configurable.

	* cc-vars.el (c-mode-common-hook): Do not change the format string
	to "CC Mode Common Hook" since that causes confusion (although it
	is a more accurate name).

2003-01-20  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (javadoc-font-lock-keywords,
	autodoc-font-lock-keywords): Support for Javadoc and Pike Autodoc
	doc comments.

	* cc-vars.el (c-doc-comment-style): New variable to control the
	fontification of documentation comments on top of the normal mode
	font lock.

2003-01-14  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el, cc-fonts.el (c-primary-expr-regexp,
	c-font-lock-declarations): Avoid false recognition of parens as
	casts when they are followed by an operator that is both prefix
	and infix.

2003-01-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-guess-fill-prefix): Tuned the heuristics of when
	to use `c-block-comment-prefix' for an unclosed block comment.

2002-12-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-nonsymbol-sexp-kwds,
	c-forward-keyword-clause): Handle keywords like "extern" that can
	be followed by e.g. a string literal.

	* cc-defs.el (c-make-keywords-re): Make a regexp correctly with
	one submatch when adorn is set and the list is empty.

2002-12-14  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Fixed a search that
	could go far past the relevant region and cause slowness.  Do not
	limit the declaration detection to the fontified region since that
	can cause misfontification in multiline declarations.

	* cc-engine.el (c-find-decl-spots): Added limit argument to handle
	declarations spanning the fontification limit better.

2002-12-10  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-in-literal, c-literal-limits,
	c-literal-limits-fast, c-beginning-of-inheritance-list): Use the
	paren cache instead of the impaired ad hoc in
	`beginning-of-defun', so that these functions doesn't trip up on
	"{" in the first column inside strings or comments.

2002-12-06  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-hanging-braces-alist): Added `statement-cont' and
	made it auto newline free by default.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Added `statement-cont' to the
	list of syntactic symbols to consider for auto newlines since it
	can be used for in-statement brace lists.

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): There's no need to have this
	constant autoloaded.

2002-12-04  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Use
	`c-recognize-typeless-decls' to avoid fontifying some macro
	constructs as declarations in languages where a preceding type is
	mandatory.

        * cc-langs.el (c-recognize-typeless-decls): New language variable.

2002-11-30  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-close-paren): Use `c-syntactic-eol' when
	checking if the open paren ends its line.

	* cc-langs.el (c-syntactic-eol): Handle a line continuation
	backslash.

2002-11-26  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-snug-do-while): Compatibility fix for changed
	structure in `c-syntactic-context'.

2002-11-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state): Filter angle bracket arglist
	parens in a better way than disabling the syntax table properties
	completely.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-cpp-matchers): Handle line continuations in cpp
	expressions. Do not fontify symbols after #ifdef etc as variables
	since that isn't consistent with how the face is used elsewhere
	(i.e. only for the definition of the symbol).

2002-11-24  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Added autoload directives for the interface
	functions in cc-langs.

2002-11-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Added a property to
	handle refontication in multiline declaration arglists better.

	(c-font-lock-<>-arglists): Fix to handle recursive template
	arglists better.  (As a side effect this will make fontification
	work better in older emacsen too.)

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-<>-arglist,
	c-remove-<>-arglist-properties): Use a common text property
	`c-type' for all sorts of CC Mode char classification, to avoid
	cases when then same char is given conflicting types.

	(c-forward-<>-arglist): New reparse argument to control that
	aspect explicitly.

	(c-forward-name, c-forward-type): Changes in the handling of
	recursive template arglists.  Fixes to cope with the new 'known
	type classification.

2002-11-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): Added the new char property
	`c-type' to `text-property-default-nonsticky'.

	* cc-defs.el (c-put-char-property, c-get-char-property,
	c-clear-char-property, c-clear-char-properties): Generalized
	`c-put-char-syntax' and `c-get-char-syntax' to handle any
	property.

	* cc-bytecomp.el (cc-bytecomp-defun): Fixed bug that caused
	existing function definitions to be overridden by phonies when the
	bytecomp environment is restored.

2002-11-15  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-mask-paragraph): Masking is necessary in normal
	code too to avoid getting a fill prefix from a nearby comment.
	Changed the name from `c-mask-comment' to a more accurate one.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-mode.el: Changed the auto-load-alist strategy to
	not add entries on package load, to be defensive in the case that
	autoloads are updated in older emacsen.  The bug that would occur
	in that case would probably be rather nasty for the average user.

2002-11-14  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Fine tuning of the
	decision tree that tells declarations from expressions to produce
	better results in some ambiguous cases.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-syntactic-face-function): Removed since
	it doesn't give the control we want.

	(c-font-lock-invalid-string): Replacement for
	`c-font-lock-syntactic-face-function' that puts the error face on
	the string opener only, to avoid the annoying excessive use of the
	error face while a string literal is being written.

        (c-basic-matchers-before): Use `c-font-lock-invalid-string'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-string-syntax, c-string-limit-regexp): Added
	constants to use when handling string limits, since not all old
	emacsen react well to the "|" syntax class.

	(c-literal-limits, c-literal-limits-fast, c-literal-type): Use
	`c-string-syntax' and `c-string-limit-regexp'.  Replaced some
	hardcoded comment start regexps with `c-comment-start-regexp'.

2002-11-08  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Added an association for pike-mode on
	`intepreter-mode-alist'.

2002-11-04  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Add the `auto-mode-alist' entries to the end instead
	of the start of the list, to avoid overriding user additions that
	are made before this file is loaded when the entries don't
	correspond to any already on `auto-mode-alist'.

	This is done through the third append argument to
	`auto-mode-alist'.  That doesn't exist in older (X)Emacsen, so the
	function is adviced in cc-defs.  However, that advice doesn't help
	if the autoloads are updated in an old (X)Emacs with this version
	of CC Mode, but I believe it's unlikely that anyone does that when
	CC Mode isn't distributed with with it.

	* cc-defs.el (add-to-list): Added advice to get the optional third
	append argument in older (X)Emacsen.

	* cc-langs.el (c-keywords-obarray): Kludge for strange bug in
	Emacs that gives so odd errors that I frankly don't even muster to
	begin trying to narrow it down.  If someone is so inclined,
	restore the commented code, byte compile, and try to open a C++
	file or something in font lock mode.

2002-11-03  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el: Updated the IDL support from the specs.  This also
	adds the keywords for the variants PSDL and CIDL.  (This is mostly
	done from reading the grammars only; very lightly tested.)

        * cc-langs.el (c-type-list-kwds): Added "new" in Java.

	* cc-fonts.el: Made sure that `parse-sexp-lookup-properties' is
	properly insulated from clobbering by the font-lock package at all
	relevant entry points.

2002-11-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-opt-after-id-concat-key): New language constant
	to make the recognition of identifier qualifiers more flexible.
	Recognize the identifier before ".*" as a qualifier in Java.

	(c-identifier-key): Recognize "::*" inside identifiers in C++.
	Recognize identifiers ending with ".*" in Java for the sake of
	import directives.

	(c-type-list-kwds, c-ref-list-kwds): Recognize "import" and
	"package" declarations in Java.

	* cc-vars.el (c-doc-face, c-doc-marker-face, c-doc-markup-face):
	Removed since they aren't used (and probably won't be).

	* cc-langs.el (c-ref-list-kwds): New language constant to specify
	keywords followed by references.

	(c-last-identifier-range): New variable to avoid going back to
	search for the identifier to font lock after a call to
	`c-forward-name'.

	(c-type-prefix-kwds, c-type-list-kwds): Fixed classification of
	"@interface" etc in Objective-C.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-keyword-clause): Fixed handling of
	keyword prefixes in `c-type-list-kwds' and
	`c-colon-type-list-kwds' clauses.

	(c-keyword-sym, c-keyword-member): New functions to lookup and
	categorize keywords.

	(c-forward-keyword-clause): New function to move over a keyword
	and its associated clause according to `c-<>-arglist-kwds' etc.

	* cc-langs.el (c-typeless-decl-kwds, c-type-list-kwds,
	c-colon-type-list-kwds, c-colon-type-list-re, c-paren-type-kwds):
	New language constants and variables to generalize the recognition
	of various language constructs.

	(c-keywords): Did away with the list of `*-kwds' constants.  It's
	now built through macro expansion.

	(c-keywords-obarray): New language variable which contains each
	keyword as a symbol, to make fast reverse lookup of keywords to
	the `*-kwds' lists they come from.

2002-10-31  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-lang-defconst-eval-immediately): Added macro to be
	able to do direct evaluation in `c-lang-defconst' forms.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Fixed a bug which
	could cause the point to end up outside the containing sexp if
	PAREN-LEVEL was used.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el: Generalized the C++
	template arglist support to handle angle bracket arglists in any
	language.

	(c-recognize-<>-arglists, c-<>-arglist-kwds,
	c-opt-<>-arglist-start): New language variables to control angle
	bracket arglists.

	(c-opt-type-suffix-key): Use `c-recognize-<>-arglists' in
	Objective-C instead of matching a protocol reference list as a
	type suffix.

2002-10-30  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-gnu-impose-minimum): Fixed a missing
	`save-excursion' that caused the point to jump around.

2002-10-26  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

        * cc-mode.el, cc-menus.el (objc-mode, cc-imenu-init): Fixed
	initialization bug that has made the Objective-C support
	inoperational since 5.26.

	(cc-imenu-objc-generic-expression): Updated submatch indices due
	to changes in `cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression'.

	(cc-imenu-objc-function): Don't add an empty "C" menu since imenu
	doesn't like that.

2002-10-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-arglist,
	c-lineup-arglist-close-under-paren, c-lineup-close-paren): Added
	DWIM to the functions that line up at or after the arglist open
	paren to avoid that if there are brace blocks inside, e.g. when a
	macro contains a code block.

2002-10-24  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (objc-font-lock-extra-types): Changed default to
	treat identifiers starting with capital letters as types,
	according to Objective-C naming conventions.  The types previously
	on the list is part of the language and therefore on
	`c-primitive-type-kwds' instead.

	* cc-fonts.el: Fixed font locking in Objective-C.  Be more careful
	about returning nil from functions used directly as font-lock
	matchers.

	* cc-mode.el (c-font-lock-init): Made the syntax table
	modification element of `font-lock-defaults' parameterized over
	the languages.

	* cc-langs.el: Updated the Objective-C constants according to the
	language spec.  The "@" chars that start directives are now
	considered part of the keywords to make things easier.

2002-10-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el:
	(c-(up|down)-list-(forward|backward)): Made the position optional
	and added docstrings.

	(c-go-(up|down)-list-(forward|backward)): Added variants of the
	above that move point and return successfulness instead.

2002-10-21  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-<>-arglists): New function to fontify
	all occurrences of template arglists in C++.

	* cc-engine.el (c-disallow-comma-in-<>-arglists): New variable to
	be able to avoid false recognition of template arglists in some
	cases.

2002-10-20  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el (c-decl-prefix-re,
	c-font-lock-declarations): Match template open brackets to get a
	declaration in the first template argument.

	(c-complex-decl-matchers): Fontify the second type in a "class X =
	Y" expression in C++.

2002-10-19  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-<>-arglist): Broke out the recursive
	part to a new function to improve efficiency when a nested
	template arglist search turns out to be futile.

2002-10-13  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-java-generic-expression): Improved to
	avoid false matches on e.g. "else if (foo)".

2002-10-11  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-token-2, c-backward-token-2): New
        functions that work like the -1 variants but that handles
        multicharacter operator tokens.

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p, c-guess-basic-syntax): Did
	away with the hardcoded regexps to recognize "typedef" declaration
	prefixes, "extern" and "namespace" blocks, "enum"-style brace list
	declarations and Java-style array initializers with "new".

	* cc-langs.el (c-brace-list-decl-kwds, c-brace-list-key,
	c-inexpr-brace-list-kwds, c-opt-inexpr-brace-list-key): New
	language constants and variables to parameterize some more of the
	hardcoded regexps in cc-engine.

2002-10-10  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-cascaded-calls): Do not allow cascaded
	call lists containing both "->" and ".".

2002-10-09  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

        * cc-align.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el,
	cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el: New language variable
	system to make it easier to set up optimized language variables
	and to extend them in third party derived modes.  cc-langs is no
	longer required at runtime.

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): No longer initializes the
	language variables.  It's necessary that the caller does that
	directly since the evaluated values for them now get compiled in
	directly.

	(c-font-lock-init, c-common-init): Separated the font-lock
	initialization from `c-common-init'.

	* cc-mode.el (c-define-abbrev-table): Do not override an existing
	abbrev table.

	(c-Java-defun-prompt-regexp): Moved here from cc-langs since
	cc-langs isn't always loaded at runtime.

	* cc-langs.el (c-make-init-lang-vars-fun, c-init-language-vars):
	Changed to allow language variable initialization from derived
	modes.

        (c-mode-menu): New language variable for the mode menu.

	(c-make-mode-syntax-table, c-mode-syntax-table,
	make-c++-template-syntax-table): New language variables for syntax
	tables.  The code that initializes them has been moved to cc-mode
	to make it possible to avoid loading cc-langs at runtime.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-hungry-delete-key, c-auto-newline,
	c-auto-hungry-string): Moved these state variables from cc-langs
	to cc-engine to make it possible to avoid loading cc-langs at
	runtime.

	* cc-defs.el (c-lang-defconst, c-lang-const): Moved from cc-langs
	and rewritten to make the language constant system usable from
	derived modes.

	(c-add-language): New function intended for use from derived modes
	that add new C-like languages.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-vars.el (c-buffer-is-cc-mode): Moved from cc-vars
	to cc-defs to define it during compilation.

	* cc-bytecomp.el (cc-require-when-compile): New support macro for
	compile time `require's.

2002-10-08  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

        * cc-defs.el, cc-mode.el (c-version): Moved from cc-mode to
        cc-defs to make it accessible to the other components.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-token-1, c-backward-token-1):
	Compatibility fix for emacsen that doesn't understand generic
	string delimiters.

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): Added detection of generic string
	and comment delimiters.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-langs.el (c-make-keywords-re): Changed interface
	to make it more extensible.

	* cc-langs.el, cc-defs.el (c-regexp-opt, c-regexp-opt-depth,
	c-make-keywords-re): Moved from cc-langs to cc-defs since they are
	generally useful.

	* cc-bytecomp.el, cc-defs.el (cc-eval-when-compile): Moved from
	cc-bytecomp to cc-defs to allow use at runtime.

2002-10-04  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-bytecomp.el (cc-eval-when-compile): Workaround for a bug with
	nested `eval-when-compile' in XEmacs 21.

2002-09-27  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Added autoloaded forms to install the appropriate
	file suffixes on `auto-mode-alist'.  Necessary in XEmacs 21.5, and
	it can be useful elsewhere too.

2002-09-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-cascaded-calls): Handle "." too, for use
	in Java.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-sws, c-backward-sws): Do not handle cpp
	directives in languages that doesn't have any.

2002-09-22  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-operators): Added a high level description of all
	operators, along with their precedence and associativity.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-multi-inher): Fixed bug where the position
	of the point and not the beginning of the line was used to
	calculate the indentation.

2002-09-18  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el (c-backward-single-comment,
	c-backward-comments): Added kludge for the bug in
	`forward-comment' in most (X)Emacs versions where it moves back
	over the "*/" of a block comment if there's no matching "/*".
	This has become more important now since it can cause incorrect
	caching by `c-backward-sws'.

2002-09-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-hungry-backspace, c-hungry-delete-forward): New
	functions to do hungry deletion regardless of hungry-delete mode.
	Contributed by Kevin Ryde.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-sws, c-backward-sws,
	c-invalidate-sws-region): Use text properties to cache regions
	with complex syntactic whitespace.  This helps a lot in improving
	responsiveness when there are lots of comments and cpp directives
	before point.

2002-09-14  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-guess.el, cc-langs.el, cc-menus.el, cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el,
	cc-vars.el, cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-defs.el:
	Introduced a classification of functions into those that make
	"hidden buffer changes" and those who don't.  This is prompted by
	the increasing use of text properties for various things, to
	correctly cover the silly buffer modifications that is caused by
	text property changes.

	(c-save-buffer-state): New macro that's put around any code that
	can manipulate text properties.

2002-09-13  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): Setup
	`text-property-default-nonsticky' to avoid messing with the
	rear-nonsticky property on each character in Emacs 21.

	* cc-defs.el (c-clear-char-syntax, c-put-char-syntax): Macros that
	sets and removes the syntax-table property on a single character
	and makes the property nonsticky in both directions in a suitable
	way for each (X)Emacs flavor.

	* cc-vars.el, cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el, cc-mode.el: Use
	`lookup-syntax-properties' in XEmacs to control whether the
	syntax-table property has any effect or not.

	(c-parse-sexp-lookup-properties): New macro that expands to either
	`parse-sexp-lookup-properties' or `lookup-syntax-properties'.

2002-09-12  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el: Put the faces into the
	buffer in the same way as the font-lock package does.  This fixes
	a compatibility problem with XEmacs which sets an extra font-lock
	property.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-put-font-lock-face): A macro that finds out the
	right way to put font lock faces at compile time.  We're
	definitely not byte code portable between Emacs and XEmacs now.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-sws, c-backward-sws): Implemented a
	cache for the last large skipped over syntactic whitespace.  This
	also has most effect after many macros.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-defs.el (c-forward-syntactic-ws,
	c-backward-syntactic-ws): Utilize the limit better when one is
	passed.  These are now macros to avoid a little overhead when no
	limit is given.

	(c-forward-sws, c-backward-sws): New functions called by the
	macros above to do the unbounded search.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarations): Implemented a cache for
	the first backward search for a preceding `c-decl-prefix-re'
	match.  This typically speeds up interactive refontification a lot
	on the top level of macro heavy header files.

2002-09-10  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-emacs-features): Added check for syntax text
	properties.

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): Turn on
	`parse-sexp-lookup-properties' if it's supported.  Define the
	variable in any case since it's used at runtime to check on this.

        * cc-langs.el (c-identifier-key): Support C++ destructor names.

	(c-identifier-start, c-op-token-regexp, c-type-modifier-kwds,
	c-opt-type-modifier-key, c-opt-type-component-key,
	c-typedef-specifier-kwds, c-typedef-specifier-key,
	c-paren-stmt-kwds, c-paren-stmt-key, c-syntactic-ws-start): A
	bunch of new language constants and variables to support the
	improved handling of names and types.

	* cc-fonts.el (c-font-lock-declarators, c-font-lock-declarations):
	Handle C++ template declarations and template references.  Fontify
	complex types and names more accurately by delegating it to
	`c-forward-type' and `c-forward-name'.  Fontify the identifiers in
	typedef declarations as types.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-<>-arglist): New function to move
	forward over a C++ template arglist.  It also marks the '<' and
	'>' chars with paren syntax using the syntax-table property, to
	speed up later calls in emacsen that support syntax text
	properties (Emacs >= 20 and (undocumented) XEmacs 21).

	This also has the very interesting effect that if font locking is
	used with decoration level 3 or higher in these emacsen then
	template arglists will behave just like paren sexps with the
	various sexp movement commands.

	(c-forward-name): New function to move over a name.  Simple in
	most languages except C++ where a name can contain template
	arglists and therefore almost arbitrary expressions.

        (c-on-identifier): Fix for Pike operator identifiers.

	(c-simple-skip-symbol-backward, c-syntactic-content,
	c-remove-<>-paren-properties): New helper functions.

	* cc-defs.el: (c-clear-char-syntax, c-mark-paren-open,
	c-mark-paren-close): New support functions to handle syntactic
	properties on C++ template arglist brackets.

        (c-put-type-face, c-put-reference-face): Helpers to put faces on
	regions, since there are a bit of that inside `c-forward-name' etc
	in cc-engine.el.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el: Fixed the names on a
	number of regexp language variables to conform to the nomenclature
	and shortened some names.

	* cc-align.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-engine.el
	(c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Removed the COUNT argument since
	it's never used.  Added an argument to tell which subexpression
	whose end should be tested for syntactic relevance.  Using this
	also removes some optimizations, so that it's possible to use a
	look behind subexpression that matches the end of a literal or a
	close paren when PAREN-LEVEL is used.

	(c-guess-continued-construct): Don't match <<= or >>= for the
	stream-op syntactic element.

	* cc-defs.el (c-paren-re, c-identifier-re): Removed these helper
	macros since better and more correct tools are now available in
	cc-langs.el.

2002-09-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-string-cont): New lineup function to line
	up string literals that will be concatenated.

2002-09-05  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-populate-syntax-table): XEmacs classifies the
	hard space character as a symbol character but it's better to let
	it be in the punctuation class so that it's always highlighted
	with the inverted invalid face.  It can perhaps be argued that
	that character is allowed in identifiers in some languages
	(haven't checked), but using it would still be extremely
	confusing.

2002-09-04  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Fixed a case when a
	labeled substatement caused incorrect association of the following
	continuation clause.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Handle the case
	when the syntactic match position is in the middle of a comment
	starter.

	(c-guess-continued-construct): Analyze the "K&R region" of a
	function nested inside a function as func-decl-cont and not
	statement-cont.  New case E.  Also cleaned up case C (stream-op
	recognition) a bit.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state, c-check-state-cache): Moved the
	check on `c-state-cache-start' from `c-check-state-cache' to
	`c-parse-state' so that the state cache isn't zapped if
	`c-check-state-cache' but not `c-parse-state' is called during a
	temporary narrowing.  This fixes a performance problem that could
	occur when `fill-paragraph' is used in font lock mode on a comment
	at the end of a large class or function.

        (c-state-cache-start): Fixed buffer localness.

2002-09-03  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el: Updates from the C99 standard (or actually from the
	latest web accessible draft of it).

2002-09-02  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el: Updated the keywords and operator tokens from the
	latest C++ and Java standards.  Some other multichar token
	corrections.

2002-09-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-vars.el (c-syntactic-context,
	c-syntactic-element): Do not bind any values to these variables
	globally since they should always be dynamically bound.  This
	makes it much easier to debug cases when they've gotten global
	values somehow.

2002-08-31  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-regexp-opt): Fix to work around the non-greedy
	behavior that the regexp engine sometimes exposes.  This bug only
	shows in (X)Emacs 19 where there's no regexp-opt package.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Added a feature to
	filter out matches in the middle of tokens.  Changed the comment
	to a docstring since I consider this function generally useful.

        * cc-defs.el (c-mode-symbol): Broke out a part of `c-mode-var'.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-cascaded-calls, c-lineup-gcc-asm-reg):
	Cope with that `c-most-enclosing-brace' might return nil.

2002-08-30  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-found-types, c-clear-found-types, c-add-type,
	c-check-type, c-add-complex-type, c-list-found-types,
	c-forward-type): Added a sort of symbol table for types: If a name
	is recognized as a type in a declaration it's added in an obarray
	to be able to recognize it in other ambiguous declarations.

	(c-remove-ws): New helper function to canonicalize fully qualified
	identifiers for `c-found-types'.

	* cc-defs.el (c-mode-var): New defsubst to access mode prefixed
	variables uniformly.

2002-08-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-arglist-close-under-paren): Work correctly
	with nested arglist-cont-nonempty symbols.

	(c-lineup-arglist-operators): New lineup function to line up infix
	operators under the open paren of the surrounding sexp.

2002-08-20  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-syntactic-ws): Fixed a bug that could
	cause an infinite loop if something that looks like a macro begins
	in the middle of a line.

	(c-parse-state): Fixed a bug that could cause `c-state-cache' to
	contain two conses in sequence when there's an unbalanced open
	paren in a macro.

2002-08-16  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-face-name-p): A defsubst to recognize the name of
	a face in a way that works also in XEmacs.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-type): New function to move past a type
	spec.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Fixed behavior
	when the limit is reached inside a comment, string, or a macro.

	* cc-align.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el (c-forward-single-comment,
	c-forward-comments, c-backward-single-comment,
	c-backward-comments): New replacements for `c-forward-comment'
	that wraps `forward-comment' more efficiently in each of the four
	different cases it's actually used.  These replacements also
	treats line continuations as whitespace.

	(c-forward-comment): Removed.  The four different cases above are
	basically different, so it's better to make them into separate
	functions than choose between them at runtime using the argument.

2002-08-11  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-gnu-impose-minimum): Fixed bug due to the new
	placement of cpp-macro and comment-intro in the syntactic context,
	as pointed out by Kevin Ryde.  Changed the method that decides
	whether point is inside a top-level construct to one that doesn't
	depend on the set of syntactic elements so much.

	* cc-defs.el (c-point): Use the functions
	`line-beginning-position' and `line-end-position' in emacsen that
        have them (currently Emacs 20 and later).

2002-07-27  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-mask-comment): Fixed a bug that sometimes caused
	code after a closed block comment to be taken into account when
	the fill prefix is calculated.

2002-07-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-arglist, c-lineup-argcont, c-lineup-math,
	c-lineup-cascaded-calls, c-lineup-gcc-asm-reg): Fixes to cope
	correctly with nested arglists for the lineups that can be used
	with arglist-cont-nonempty.

2002-07-24  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-add-stmt-syntax, c-guess-basic-syntax): Changed
	the anchor position of arglist-cont-nonempty and arglist-close so
	that a relative indentation like + can be used with consistent
	results.  Prior to this, the indentation engine more or less
	assumed that arglist-cont-nonempty always used `c-lineup-arglist'.
	Those two syntax symbols also get the opening paren as an extra
	position, to make it possible for `c-lineup-arglist' to continue
	to do a proper job.

	* cc-engine.el (c-get-syntactic-indentation): A vector with an
	absolute indentation column now only overrides the indentation for
	surrounding structures, i.e. those whose syntactic elements are
	earlier in the `c-syntactic-context' list, but not nested ones.
	This so that e.g. `c-lineup-arglist' can reliably line up with the
	first argument but still allow relative indentation changes for
	nested things, e.g. the arglist-close of a nested argument list.
	This change means that the order in `c-syntactic-context' has
	become more essential.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Changes to make the nesting order of the
	returned syntax list correct.

	Compatibility note: This change means that `c-lineup-dont-change'
        now (again) isn't absolutely sure to keep the current indentation.
	However, I believe that most people use it for comments, macros
	and string literals, and since those are nested innermost it won't
	matter.

2002-06-17  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el, cc-vars.el
	(c-guess-basic-syntax, c-calc-offset, c-get-syntactic-indentation,
	c-syntactic-context): Extended the representation of the syntactic
	context: Previously it was a list containing cons cells of the
	found syntactic symbols and their relpos values.  Now each element
	is instead a list containing the syntactic symbol in the first
	element and the relpos (if any) in the second.  After that there
	might be more elements, depending on the syntactic symbol.  The
	line-up functions get these additional elements as extra
	arguments.

	This change is slightly incompatible.  Although the calling
	convention for line-up functions is strictly extended, the format
	of the `c-syntactic-context' variable has changed slightly.  It's
	believed that this incompatibility is minor, though; not a single
	line-up function distributed with CC Mode needed to be changed,
	for instance.

2002-06-08  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style, c-set-style-1): Added another state
	for the `dont-override' flag where it only keeps globally set
	variables.

2002-06-07  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-postprocess-file-styles): Do nothing except in CC
	Mode modes.

2002-06-02  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

        * cc-vars.el, cc-fonts.el, cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el: Added font
        lock support.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-syntax): New function to be used
	for font-lock-beginning-of-syntax-function.  It uses the state
	cache to quickly find a good position.

	* cc-defs.el (c-major-mode-is): Allow a list of modes.  Made it a
	macro ensure that it's optimized to either eq or memq for constant
	arguments.

	* cc-mode.el (c-common-init): Did away with the hardcoded setting
	of `comment-column'; it's a user variable that we have no business
	meddling with.  Since the default value for it is 32 in all
	supported (X)Emacs versions, it's also safe from a compatibility
	perspective.

	* cc-mode.el (c-basic-common-init): New function that contains
	only the syntax and line breaking/filling initialization.  It's
        intended for use by other modes that embed CC Mode.

2002-05-25  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-add-stmt-syntax): Fixed some cases of wrong
	anchoring, e.g. for else-if compounds.

2002-05-01  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed anchor position for
	defun-open in K&R style functions.

        * cc-engine.el (c-in-knr-argdecl): Don't trip up on macros.

	(c-search-decl-header-end): Handle C++ template arguments more
	correctly.

	(c-beginning-of-decl-1): Fix when the declaration is first in a
	macro.

2002-04-30  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-decl-1): Better way to handle
	protection labels, one which doesn't get confused by inherit
	colons.

	(c-end-of-decl-1): Don't treat functions that have "class" or
	"struct" in the return type as classes or structs.

2002-04-27  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-make-keywords-re): Fixed the keyword adornment so
	that it works when a keyword ends with "_".

2002-04-24  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-mask-comment): More fixes when used from
	`c-do-auto-fill' and point is at or near the limit of the comment.
	Fixed bug when the prefix from `c-guess-fill-prefix' is longer
	than the text on the first line of the comment when it's masked.

2002-04-23  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-mask-comment): Fixed bug where point was moved to
	the following line when it was at the first line of a block
	comment where comment-start-skip matched to eol.

Mon Apr 22 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Release 5.29 (Test version; this is not a real release.)

	* cc-engine.el: Incorporated change made in Emacs: Don't
	assume point-min == 1 when counting lines.

	* cc-mode.el: Incorporated changes made in Emacs:

	(c-define-abbrev-table): New function to pass the SYSTEM-FLAG
	to `define-abbrev' in a way that works in emacsen that doesn't
	support it.

	(c-mode-abbrev-table, c++-mode-abbrev-table,
	objc-mode-abbrev-table, java-mode-abbrev-table,
	pike-mode-abbrev-table): Mark all the predefined abbrevs as
	"system" abbrevs.

	(c-submit-bug-report): Make sure that the arguments to
	`insert' are strings.

Sun Apr 21 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-engine.el, cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el
	(c-guess-basic-syntax, c-lineup-topmost-intro-cont): Find
	correct anchor for statement-cont in top level constructs.
	Analyze variable initializations in top level constructs as
	topmost-intro-cont instead of statement-cont.  That is an
	incompatible change but it gives better consistency.  The new
	lineup function c-lineup-topmost-intro-cont' compensates for
	it and is now put on topmost-intro-cont by default.

	* cc-align.el, cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-lineup-argcont):
	Lineup function contributed by Kevin Ryde.

	(c-in-gcc-asm-p): Function to recognize asm statements.
	Contributed by Kevin Ryde.

	(c-opt-asm-stmt-key): New language variable to recognize the
	beginning of asm statements.

Sat Apr 20 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Detect variable
	declarations after class and struct declarations correctly.
	Fixed limit error when finding the anchor for
	template-args-cont and topmost-intro-cont.

Fri Apr 05 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-defun, c-declaration-limits):
	Find the "line oriented" declaration start too, just like the
	"line oriented" end is found.

Thu Apr 04 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-offsets-alist): A more sane default for
	`inexpr-statement'.  This is not compatible, though.  I think
	the benefit of a good default style outweights that in this
	case.  Besides, `inexpr-statement' is not very common.

Mon Apr 01 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-delete-forward): Fixed silly bug that
	caused it to delete backwards in hungry delete mode.  (It's
	amazing that this bug hasn't been reported.)

	* cc-cmds.el (c-declaration-limits, c-mark-function):
	Extracted the code to get the declaration limits from
	`c-mark-function' to a new `c-declaration-limits'.

	(c-indent-defun): Use the same method to get the limits of the
	declaration or macro as `c-mark-function'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-decl-1): Handle brace list
	initializers correctly (but costly; it ought to be integrated
	into `c-beginning-of-statement-1').

Sun Mar 31 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-defun,
	c-end-of-defun, c-mark-function): Rewritten to detect the
	declaration limits better.  Now handles K&R argdecls, class
	definitions followed by variables etc.

	(c-in-knr-argdecl): Broke out the K&R argdecl test in
	`c-beginning-of-decl-1' to this new function.

	(c-end-of-statement-1, c-end-of-decl-1): Replaced
	`c-end-of-statement-1' with `c-end-of-decl-1', which correctly
	handles declarations that continue after the block.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): Added an
	option to restrict matching to the top level of the current
	paren sexp.

	* cc-langs.el (c-opt-block-decls-with-vars-key): New regexp to
	recognize declarations that continue after the block.

	(c-syntactic-eol): New regexp to match a "syntactic" eol.

Sat Mar 30 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed a bug that often
	caused the backward limit to be lost at the top level.  This
	improves performance a bit.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-re-search-forward): New function
	that works like `re-search-forward' but only returns matches
	in syntactically significant text.

	* cc-engine.el: Fixed a faster and more accurate way to
	recognize K&R argdecls.

	(c-beginning-of-decl-1): New function that put point at the
	beginning of the declaration.  It handles K&R argdecl blocks.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Replaced the `knr-argdecl' recognition
	code with one that doesn't depend on the current indentation.
	The anchor position for `knr-argdecl' has also changed, but in
	a way that is unlikely to cause compatibility problems.

Mon Mar 25 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el (c-forward-comment):
	`forward-comment' in XEmacs skips over line continuations in
	the backward direction.  Correct for that.  Also made this a
	defun since it has grown too large now to be a defsubst.

	* cc-langs.el: More convenient and decentralized setup of the
	language specific variables.  The regexp-opt mangling is also
	done at compile time now.

Tue Mar 19 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-line-or-region): Call `c-indent-line'
	directly instead of through `indent-according-to-mode' so that
	this function always indents syntactically.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed a bug where a
	class beginning with a nested class could cause an infinite
	loop (the state outside the narrowed out class is never used
	now).

Sun Mar 17 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-vars.el: Fixes so
	that the context sensitive analysis inside macros is
	restricted to the bodies of #define's; other things, like #if
	expressions, never have anything in common with their
	surroundings.  The old `cpp-macro-cont' syntax is now used in
	situations where the syntactic analysis isn't applicable, and
	a new syntactic element `cpp-define-intro' is used to add
	indentation in #define bodies.

	(c-lineup-cpp-define): New name for `c-lineup-macro-cont' to
	better reflect its use.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Ignore line
	continuation backslashes in the detection of
	`arglist-cont-nonempty'.

	* cc-align.el: Use the vector form in the return value in all
	cases where lineup functions return absolute columns.

Sat Mar 16 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-add-stmt-syntax, c-guess-basic-syntax):
	Anchor `brace-list-intro' and `brace-list-close' better for
	brace lists nested inside expressions.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el: Cleaned
	up the various language specific variables and their
	initialization.  The keyword regexps are now lists that are
	combined with regexp-opt.  Some variables have changed names
	to fit better with the naming convention.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-vars.el (c-buffer-is-cc-mode): The value is
	the mode symbol of the original CC Mode mode.

	(c-major-mode-is): Compare against the buffer local variable
	`c-buffer-is-cc-mode', which is faster than using
	`derived-mode-class'.

Sun Mar 10 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-syntactic-ws,
	c-backward-syntactic-ws, c-forward-token-1,
	c-backward-token-1, c-in-literal, c-literal-limits,
	c-collect-line-comments, c-literal-type, c-on-identifier,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): These functions are now considered part
	of the "CC Mode API" and may be used by other code.  That's
	signified by making their documentation into docstrings.

	(c-whack-state, c-hack-state, c-skip-case-statement-forward):
	Removed these internal functions since they aren't used.

	(c-forward-to-cpp-expression): Classified this function as
	internal.

Thu Mar 07 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-ObjC-class-key, c-Java-class-key): Simplified
	these regexps; the class keywords they contain ought to be
	enough to avoid false matches, so checking for following
	identifiers etc is just unnecessary (and might also fail for
	oddly formatted code).

Fri Feb 08 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-cmds.el (c-forward-comment-lc): New
	function that behaves like `c-forward-comment', with the
	exception that line continuations are treated as whitespace.

	(c-beginning-of-statement): Use `c-forward-comment-lc', to
	work correctly in macros and other places where line
	continuations should be treated as whitespace.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Analyze a normal label
	in a switch block as a case label, to get consistent lineup
	with the case labels.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-syntactic-ws): Fixed bug in
	skipping over a macro that ends with an empty line.

	* cc-styles.el: Require cc-align since styles added with
	`c-add-style' often contains references to functions defined
	there, and so the `c-valid-offset' check might otherwise
	complain on them.

Sun Jan 20 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-mode.texi, cc-vars.el: Added two new lineup
	functions:

	(c-lineup-knr-region-comment): A new lineup function to get
	(what most people think is) better indentation of comments in
	the "K&R region" between the function header and its body.

	(c-lineup-gcc-asm-reg): New lineup function for better
	indentation inside gcc asm blocks.  Contributed by Kevin Ryde.

	(c-offsets-alist): Use `c-lineup-gcc-asm-reg' and
	`c-lineup-knr-region-comment' in the default offset
	configuration, since these two functions have little impact
	outside their intended use, and they generally do the right
	thing when they kick in.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-continued-construct,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Handle nested functions in all
	languages, not just Pike.  In C and C++ there's a gcc
	extension for this, and it also gives better treatment of
	macros that are followed by blocks.

	* cc-langs.el (c-symbol-key): Made this variable mode
	specific, to handle Pike special symbols like `== better.

Sat Jan 19 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-vars.el
	(c-report-syntactic-errors): A new variable to control the
	syntactic error messages.  It defaults to off; since CC Mode
	ignores most syntactic errors it might as well ignore them all
	for the sake of consistency.

Sat Jan 05 2002  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Updated the Limitations and Known Bugs
	section.  Various small fixes.

Thu Nov 29 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Optimization.  Can
	give a noticeable speedup if there's a large preceding
	function or class body.

Sun Nov 25 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-cmds.el: Use more efficient and correct
	insertion functions in many places.  Always inherit text
	properties correctly if the text is permanent.  Also do it for
	speed in temporary insertions, since I figure it's less work
	to continue the surrounding text properties than to break
	them.

	* cc-styles.el (c-read-offset): Unbind SPC in the completion
	to make it easier to enter lists.

Wed Nov 21 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-defun): Fixed bug where
	c-state-cache was clobbered.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el (c-calculate-state): Moved from
	cc-cmds.el to cc-engine.el due to dependency.

Mon Oct 22 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state): Ignore unbalanced open parens
	in macros (if point isn't in the same one).

Sat Oct 13 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-context-open-line): New function that is the
	`open-line' equivalent to `c-context-line-break'.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-base-map): Compatibility fix for Emacs 21
	since `indent-new-comment-line' has been changed to
	`comment-indent-new-line' there.

Sun Oct 07 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el (c-stmt-delim-chars,
	c-stmt-delim-chars-with-comma): New variables containing the
	character sets used to recognize statement/declaration
	boundaries.  These variables might help to support languages
	like javascript and awk, where newlines sometimes delimits
	statements.

	(c-crosses-statement-barrier-p): Use `c-stmt-delim-chars' as
	the set of statement delimiting characters, to allow it to be
	changed dynamically and per-mode.

Sat Oct 06 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-bos, c-looking-at-inexpr-block,
	c-add-stmt-syntax, c-guess-basic-syntax): Treat blocks
	directly inside function calls like "bare" statements inside
	function calls, and not like in-expression statements.  This
	to make indentation of such blocks consistent with other
	statements inside macro calls.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Made arglist-cont
	anchor correctly in arglists that contain statements.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed consistent
	anchoring of defun-block-intro in defuns in code blocks (can
	only occur in Pike).

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block,
	c-looking-at-inexpr-block-backward): Changed the arguments to
	require containing sexps and paren state, for better
	efficiency.

Fri Oct 05 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-vars.el: Improved anchoring of
	statement and handling of labels in front of substatements.

	(c-guess-continued-construct, c-guess-basic-syntax): Improved
	and unified anchoring at statements.  Statements beginning
	with comments or labels are now avoided, by going out of
	blocks and containing statements if necessary.  This nesting
	handling also fixes the case when there's a statement after a
	block open brace.  Added the syntactic symbol
	`substatement-label'.

	(c-electric-colon): Map the new `substatement-label' to
	`label' when consulting `c-hanging-colons-alist'.

	(c-offsets-alist): Added substatement-label.  Updated the
	comments for the new anchoring positions at statements.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Use more sane anchor
	points for knr-argdecl-intro and access-label.  They used to
	refer to some point on the same line, a bug which was
	neutralized by a kludge in `c-get-syntactic-indentation' which
	ignored such anchor points.

	(c-get-syntactic-indentation): Removed the kludge that was
	necessary due to buggy anchor points.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Do not check the
	absence of a comma before arglist-close (case 7A) in any
	language, since there's nothing better to do that case anyway.
	Added special case to make in-expression statements be
	recognized as normal arglist-cont if we're directly in a macro
	arglist, for consistency with other "bare" statements.

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-bos): Added optional limit arg
	for backward searches.

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Anchor gcc
	in-expression statements at the surrounding open parenthesis.
	Treat a class body as an in-expression class if it's used in
	an object clone expression in Pike.

	* cc-engine.el (c-get-offset, c-get-syntactic-indentation):
	Allow several anchor positions in the list of syntactic
	symbols.  Only the first is used as the base for the offset
	calculation.

Tue Oct 02 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-defun): Indent the current macro if
	inside one at the top level.  Do not throw an error if used at
	the top level outside a macro.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-backslash-region): Do tab width alignment only
	if the backslashes can't be aligned with surrounding
	backslashes.

	* cc-engine.el (c-end-of-macro): New function.

	* cc-engine.el (c-least-enclosing-brace): Rewritten to not be
	destructive.

Sat Sep 29 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-context-line-break): Only do a macro line
	break when point is inside the content of it; if it's in the
	cpp keyword a normal line break is done.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Do not add
	cpp-macro-cont inside the argument list to a #define.

Thu Sep 27 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-forward-comment): Implemented a kludge to
	avoid the problem most forward-comment incarnations have with
	`\' together with comment parsing.

Wed Sep 26 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-check-state-cache): Fixed bug which could
	cause the state returned by `c-parse-state' to lack a closed
	paren element.  That in turn could result in very long
	searches, since it's common that they start from the last
	preceding close brace.

Tue Sep 25 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Do not treat
	else-if as a single continuation, since that'd make it hard to
	get the right anchor point when there's a line break between
	the two keywords.  This change causes else-clause to be
	anchored on the closest preceding else-if and not always on
	the starting if, but that doesn't affect the indentation for
	any reasonably sane style.  Also introduced a noerror flag.

	(c-beginning-of-closest-statement): Removed;
	c-beginning-of-statement-1 now avoids the problem this one
	solved.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-continued-construct,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Better and more uniform anchor points
	for 'statement-cont and 'substatement.  The effect is
	noticeable mostly when there's a label on the same line as the
	beginning of the statement, or when there are more stuff
	before the start of the statement.

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Added flag to
	disable looking at the type of the surrounding paren since
	that confuses c-beginning-of-statement-1 and a couple of other
	places.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Avoid stepping to the
	previous statement in case 18.  Improvements in recognition of
	statement blocks on the top level.

Sun Sep 23 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1,
	c-crosses-statement-barrier-p): Rewritten to get a well
	defined and documented behavior.  This fixes some tricky cases
	in recognition of do-while constructs.

	(c-backward-to-start-of-do, c-backward-to-start-of-if):
	Removed; use c-beginning-of-statement-1 instead.

	(c-guess-continued-construct, c-guess-basic-syntax): Various
	fixes to not depend on the bugs previously in
	c-beginning-of-statement-1.  Cleanups in cases 18 and 17 to
	use the new behavior of c-beginning-of-statement-1 better.
	Fixed recognition of catch blocks inside macros.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-syntactic-ws): Fixed bug in
	skipping over a macro.

	* cc-langs.el (c-label-kwds): New variable to contain the
	appropriate c-*-label-kwds value.

	* cc-vars.el (defcustom-c-stylevar): Fixed value evaluation
	bug that caused the widget for c-block-comment-prefix to bug
	out.

Fri Sep 21 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Improved recognition of
	statements: They are now recognized in contexts where they
	normally can't occur, e.g. on the top level or in function
	call arguments.  This is mainly useful to recognize statements
	in macros at the top level, and in arguments to macros.  The
	cases has been moved around quite a bit, and case 10 has been
	copied to case 18.  (The cases has not been renumbered because
	of this.)

	(c-guess-continued-construct): New function which has the
	rules which are common between cases 10 and 18.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1,
	c-backward-to-start-of-do, c-backward-to-start-of-if): Fixes
	so that they really obey the passed limits.

	(c-safe-position): Return nil if the state doesn't contain a
	suitable position.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixes some too short limits in calls
	to c-beginning-of-statement-1.  Some fixes for top level
	analysis in ObjC mode.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Fixed bug in
	do-while statements where the body is not a block.

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style): Reset c-special-indent-hook to
	its global value if in override mode.  Fixes problem where
	functions on that hook remained after style switch.

	* cc-engine.el (c-evaluate-offset, c-get-offset): Use
	c-benign-error to report the c-strict-syntax-p error.

Thu Sep 20 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-defs.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el,
	cc-vars.el: Several fixes to treat macros as code and not
	literals and to handle line continuations transparently.

	(c-skip-ws-forward, c-skip-ws-backward): New macros to skip
	through whitespace and line continuations, but not comments
	and macros.

	(c-in-literal): No longer recognizes macros as literals by
	default. An extra flag argument is required to do that.

	(c-macro-start, c-query-macro-start,
	c-query-and-set-macro-start): Added a cache for the macro
	start position.

	(c-forward-syntactic-ws, c-backward-syntactic-ws): Fixes for
	more speed when limits are given.  Workaround for bad behavior
	in forward-comment in some emacsen when it hits a buffer limit
	with a large repeat count.

	(c-lineup-macro-cont): Improved behavior when
	c-syntactic-indentation-in-macros is nil.

	(c-syntactic-indentation-in-macros, c-backslash-max-column,
	c-auto-align-backslashes): New customization variables to
	control macro handling.

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression): Fixes to
	handle line continuations.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-styles.el (c-get-style-variables,
	c-set-offset): Report style errors with message and ding
	instead of error signal.  This to avoid interrupted mode init
	if there's some style problem.

	(c-benign-error): New macro to report errors that doesn't need
	to interrupt the operation.

	* cc-defs.el (c-point): Added eonl and eopl positions.

Tue Sep 18 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace, c-indent-region): Removed most
	of the c-state-cache fiddling, since the global state cache
	now handles this.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug when there's
	an open paren at the very first char of the visible buffer
	region.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state, c-check-state-cache): Cache the
	state globally and invalidate it below every buffer change
	with the new after change function `c-check-state-cache'.
	This gives a considerable performance boost when editing large
	functions or classes.

	* cc-engine.el (c-whack-state-after): Slight optimization.

Sun Sep 16 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el, cc-align.el: Improvements to
	syntactic analysis inside macros:

	(c-block-stmt-1-kwds, c-block-stmt-2-kwds): New variables used
	by `c-guess-basic-syntax'.

	(c-parse-state): Fixed bug with braces inside macros when
	using cached state info.

	(c-forward-to-cpp-expression): New function to aid in
	syntactic analysis inside macros.

	(c-beginning-of-statement-1, c-backward-syntactic-ws): Fixes
	to work better inside macros.

	(c-forward-syntactic-ws): Whitespace between the # and the
	command should be allowed in preprocessor directives.

	(c-lineup-macro-cont): New lineup function to get context
	sensitive indentation inside macros.

	(c-offsets-alist): Made `c-lineup-macro-cont' the default for
	cpp-macro-cont.

Sat Sep 15 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1,
	c-forward-syntactic-ws): Fixes to handle continued lines.

	(c-backward-to-start-of-if, c-guess-basic-syntax): Do
	syntactic analysis inside macros.

Sat Sep 08 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-region): Did a speedup made possible by
	the more flexible state cache.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state, c-whack-state-before,
	c-whack-state-after, c-hack-state,
	c-narrow-out-enclosing-class, c-guess-basic-syntax): Improved
	the state cache system.  It now can use partial info from an
	old cached state to calculate a new one at a different
	position.  Removed some kludges to avoid the state cache.  The
	new functions `c-whack-state-before' and `c-whack-state-after'
	replace the now obsolete `c-whack-state'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Optimized backing
	through a macro.  This can speed things up quite a bit when
	there are long macros before point.

	(c-beginning-of-macro): Do not ignore the limit.

Sun Sep 02 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-continued-statement): Fixed a bug
	where the keyword wasn't reindented correctly if followed by
	another keyword or identifier.

	* cc-engine.el (c-parse-state): Ignore closed brace pairs that
	are in macros.  Fixes some cases where e.g. the second of two
	"do { } while (0)" macros after each other indented
	differently.

Fri Aug 31 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-macro, c-forward-syntactic-ws):
	Recognize "#!" as a preprocessor directive when it begins a
	line, to allow for script interpreter lines like
	"#!/usr/bin/pike" at the beginning of the file.

Thu Aug 30 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Recognize brace
	blocks inside a parenthesis expression as inexpr-statement.
	Useful when writing statements as macro arguments.

Sat Aug 25 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph, c-do-auto-fill,
	c-mask-comment): Broke out the comment masking code from
	`c-fill-paragraph' to a new function `c-mask-comment', to be
	able to do the same thing in `c-do-auto-fill'.  This should
	make auto-fill-mode behave better.

Mon Aug 20 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace, c-electric-paren): Check
	`executing-macro' to avoid blinking parens when macros are
	executed.

	* cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el (c-setup-filladapt): Moved from
	cc-mode.el to cc-styles.el for consistency with
	`c-setup-paragraph-variables' (which was placed there due to
	the dependency from `c-set-style').

	* cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el: Fixed bug with incomplete
	initialization from the style variable fallbacks if there
	already is a style called "user" defined when CC Mode starts
	up for the first time.

Fri Aug 17 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-vars.el (c-comment-indent,
	c-indent-comment-alist): Added new variable
	`c-indent-comment-alist' to allow better control over
	`c-comment-indent'.

Tue Aug 14 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-C-comments): Try to match both
	`comment-start-skip' and the comment prefix on the current
	line with the comment starter, so that we line up comments
	which matches `c-comment-prefix-regexp' on the first line
	(after the `/') without the need to make `comment-start-skip'
	match whatever `c-comment-prefix-regexp' matches.

	* cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el (c-common-init, c-set-style-1,
	c-setup-paragraph-variables): Moved the variable
	initialization based on `c-comment-prefix-regexp' to a new
	function `c-setup-paragraph-variables', which is now used both
	at mode init and when a style that sets
	`c-comment-prefix-regexp' is activated.

Sat Aug 11 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-member-init-list): Better
	handling of C++ template args to avoid confusion with `<' and
	`>' used as operators in member init expressions.

Wed Jul 25 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-most-enclosing-brace,
	c-least-enclosing-brace): Added optional second arg to limit
	the search to before a certain point.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug which could
	cause incorrect analysis if a cached state is used (usually
	only happens when an electric key reindents a line).

Tue Jul 24 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-forward-comment): More idiosyncrasy
	insulation.  This time for XEmacs 21.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-langs.el: Improved handling of inheritance
	lists:

	(c-beginning-of-inheritance-list): Rewritten to use a more
	syntactically correct method that doesn't get confused by
	badly placed linebreaks and comments.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Several fixes to the handling of
	inheritance lists in combination with templates.  'inher-intro
	is now anchored on the start of the class declaration and not
	the indentation of the current line.  Switched places on cases
	5D.3 and 5D.4 and made them use more syntactically correct
	methods.

	(c-inher-key): Removed since the code in
	`c-guess-basic-syntax' now uses token-based search.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-mode.el (c-mode-menu): Added a submenu to
	access some toggles.

	(c-toggle-syntactic-indentation): New function to toggle the
	variable `c-syntactic-indentation'.

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style): Improved the error message for
	incorrect offsets a bit.

Mon Jul 23 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-exp): Don't require that the sexp
	follows point immediately, instead find the closest following
	open paren that ends on another line.

Sat Jul 21 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-cascaded-calls): New indentation function.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-macro): Bugfix for directives
	with whitespace between the '#' and the name.

	* cc-mode.texi: Rearranged the indentation functions in
	alphabetic order.  Documented c-lineup-cascaded-calls.

Fri Jul 20 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-syntactic-ws,
	c-backward-syntactic-ws): Handle line continuations as
	whitespace.  Don't move past a macro if that'd take us past
	the limit.

Wed Jul 11 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-macro, c-forward-syntactic-ws):
	Multiline strings begin with `#"' in Pike, and that shouldn't
	be confused with a preprocessor directive.

Mon Jul 09 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: Extended the kludge to interoperate with the
	delsel and pending-del packages wrt to the new function
	`c-electric-delete-forward'.

Fri Jul 06 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-exp): Keep the indentation of the block
	itself, i.e. only indent the contents in it.

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style): Use the default argument to
	completing-read instead of initial-contents, if the function
	is recent enough to support it.

Mon Jun 11 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-help-address): Removed
	bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org from the receiver list for bug reports.
	I've almost never seen a bug reported this way that should go
	to that list, but it's rather common that the reports concern
	the combination CC Mode and XEmacs instead.

Sun Jun 10 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-paren): Fixed bug when both
	brace-elseif-brace and brace-catch-brace are active and
	there's a "else if"-block before the catch block.

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression): Detect
	function headers that span lines.

Sat May 12 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace, c-electric-semi&comma,
	c-electric-colon, c-electric-paren): Check for last on line
	only for doing the auto-newline-mode stuff, not for the
	reindentation.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Fixed bugs in the handling of
	c-syntactic-indentation: When it's nil, indent the new lines
	but don't reindent the current one.  Reindent the line only
	when the inserted brace comes first on it, instead of last.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace, c-electric-semi&comma): Fixed
	two places where c-syntactic-indentation wasn't heeded.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-pound): Don't be electric inside a
	macro.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-to-start-of-if): Try a little
	harder to find a fallback position when an orphan else is
	found.  Fixed case where an else following a do-while
	statement could be associated with an if inside the do-while.

Fri May 11 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-guess-fill-prefix): Tuned the dwim for the
	fallback to add a single space after the comment prefix.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-new-comment-line): Somewhat better
	behavior in some special cases, especially for single-line
	comments.  Avoid breaking up a comment starter or ender.

Sat May 05 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-outline-level): Applied patch from the Emacs
	sources to make this work in invisible text.

	* cc-langs.el (c-switch-label-key): Fixed regexp to not be
	confused by a later ':' on the same line as the label.

Wed May 02 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-mode.el (c-electric-delete,
	c-electric-delete-forward): Split `c-electric-delete' into two
	functions where `c-electric-delete-forward' always deletes
	forward and `c-electric-delete' only contains the code
	necessary for XEmacs to choose between backward and forward
	deletion.  `c-electric-delete-forward' is now bound to C-d to
	get the electric behavior on that key too.

	* cc-mode.texi: Updated the doc for hungry-delete mode wrt the
	Backspace/Delete key handling.  Also incorporated a small
	clarification from the Emacs people.

Wed Mar 14 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Fixed bogus direct use of
	c-comment-prefix-regexp, which caused an error when it's a
	list.

Sun Feb 25 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Release 5.28

Sun Feb 25 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el, cc-vars.el (c-common-init, c-default-style):
	Removed the hardcoded switch to "java" style in Java mode.
	It's instead taken care of by the default value for
	c-default-style.

	* cc-mode.texi: Documented the electric keyword feature.
	Updated the mentions of the "java" style special case for Java
	mode.

Sat Feb 24 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-math): Fix bug where lineup was
	triggered by equal signs in string literals.

Sun Feb 25 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.el, cc-vars.el (c-common-init, c-default-style):
	Removed the hardcoded switch to "java" style in Java mode.
	It's instead taken care of by the default value for
	c-default-style.

	* cc-mode.texi: Updated the mentions of the "java" style
	special case for Java mode.

Sat Feb 24 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-math): Fix bug where lineup was
	triggered by equal signs in string literals.

Wed Feb 21 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Fixed bug in the paragraph
	limit detection when at the ends of the buffer.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Removed bogus check for
	"for" statement clause in case 7F; a better one is done
	earlier in case 7D anyway.

Tue Feb 20 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-guess-fill-prefix): Improved the heuristics
	somewhat more and did a small optimization.

Mon Feb 19 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement, c-end-of-statement):
	Use the limit argument only to limit the syntactic context
	search, not to limit the actual movement.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement): Move by sentence
	inside multiline strings, just like in comments.  Also various
	fixes to the paragraph and comment prefix recognition, block
	comment ender handling etc.

Sun Feb 18 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Take more care to preserve
	the relative position of the point.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-continued-statement): New function to
	use as abbrev hook to reindent for keywords such as "else"
	that continues an earlier statement.

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression): Treat structs
	like classes.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode, c++-mode, java-mode, objc-mode,
	pike-mode): Populate the default abbrev tables to reindent for
	keywords such as "else" that can continue earlier statements.
	Abbrev mode is therefore turned on by default now.  (Note that
	this doesn't apply to idl-mode, since IDL afaik doesn't have
	statements at all.)

Wed Feb 14 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): Fix for handling
	bracelists where the declaration contains template arguments.

Fri Feb 09 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-indent): Use
	`c-get-syntactic-indentation' to correctly calculate the
	syntactic indentation.  Fixes bug with lineup functions that
	return vectors.

	* cc-engine.el (c-get-syntactic-indentation): Split the
	indentation sum calculation from `c-indent-line' to a separate
	function.

Mon Feb 05 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement, c-comment-indent):
	Fixed places where it was assumed that preprocessor directives
	have to start in column zero.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-member-init-list): Handle C++
	template arguments after a class identifier properly.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Treat initializer brace
	lists for `new Foo[]' constructs in Java as expressions and
	not top level definition brace lists on the top level, so that
	they'll get indented consistently with the same type of
	expression in a normal block.

Sat Feb 03 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): The kludge that checks
	whether the adaptive filling package fails to keep the comment
	prefix is now kludged further to check for filladapt-mode
	which doesn't have that problem. This is really icky, but it's
	the only way that works with the current misfeatures/bugs in
	both adaptive-fill-mode and filladapt-mode.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Made the way the paragraph
	around point is recognized more robust.

Sun Jan 21 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-lobotomy.el (c-state-cache,
	c-in-literal-cache, c-auto-fill-prefix, c-lit-limits,
	c-lit-type): Fixed all internal variables used dynamically so
	that they are always bound.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el: Improved recovery of syntactic
	errors:

	(c-indent-region): Fixed reporting of syntactic errors so that
	the region is fully reindented even when an error occurs.  The
	last syntactic error is printed afterwards.  Also cleanup up a
	whole lot of code that tried to optimize indentation of whole
	sexps but in reality accomplishes nothing.

	(c-indent-sexp): Use c-indent-region.

	(c-parsing-error): Changed this variable to hold the message
	for any syntactic error that is discovered.

	(c-parse-state): Search backward from point instead of the bod
	position when the latter is invalid.  This makes CC Mode
	recover faster when there are unbalanced close braces.

	(c-backward-to-start-of-if): Use c-parsing-error to report
	dangling "else" clauses instead of throwing an error, and fall
	back to a reasonable position.

	(c-indent-line): Added argument to avoid reporting syntactic
	errors.

	(c-show-syntactic-information): Don't report any syntactic
	errors.

Wed Jan 17 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement): Fixed bugs with
	paragraph recognition when moving by sentence in literals.

	* cc-langs.el (c-Java-javadoc-paragraph-start): Modified
	paragraph start regexp for javadoc to recognize javadoc markup
	in general instead of a specific set of keywords, to be more
	future-safe.

	(c-Pike-pikedoc-paragraph-start,
	c-Pike-pikedoc-paragraph-separate): New regexps to recognize
	pikedoc markup.

	* cc-mode.el: Fixed initialization and use of
	c-current-comment-prefix.

	(pike-mode): Initialize paragraph settings pikedoc
	recognition.

	* cc-vars.el (c-default-style): Made a nicer Customize widget.

	(c-comment-prefix-regexp): Made it possible to use an
	association list on this to specify mode specific regexps.
	The default value now use a special regexp in Pike mode to
	recognize pikedoc markup.

	(c-current-comment-prefix): New variable containing the actual
	regexp from c-comment-prefix-regexp for the current buffer.

Sun Jan 14 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Fixed check for special brace
	lists: We can't look at the syntax, since a brace list can get
	recognized as a plain statement-cont.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug where a
	special brace list opener broken over two lines got recognized
	as a statement on the second line.  Case 9A changed.

Mon Jan 08 2001  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Fixed bug in c-state-cache
	adjustment after line is reindented.

Wed Dec 27 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-point): Added optional argument for position
	to use instead of the current point.

	* cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el (c-add-class-syntax): Do not add
	the in-expression block symbols when the construct starts at
	boi, to avoid the extra level of indentation in that case.
	Cases 4, 16A and 17E affected.

Sun Nov 26 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el: Use `indent-according-to-mode' instead of direct
	calls to `c-indent-line', to adhere better to Emacs
	conventions.

	* cc-engine.el (c-indent-line): Use the syntax already bound
	to `c-syntactic-context', if there is any.

Sun Nov 19 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-get-offset): Fixed bug where the indentation
	wasn't added up correctly when a lineup function returned nil.

Fri Nov 17 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-collect-line-comments): Fixed bug where
	empty lines were ignored when collecting line comments
	backwards.

Sun Oct 08 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-dont-change): Return an absolute
	indentation column to work correctly in the case when several
	syntactic elements are processed for the same line.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-styles.el, cc-vars.el (c-evaluate-offset,
	c-get-offset, c-indent-line, c-valid-offset, c-read-offset,
	c-set-offset): Added absolute indentation column settings by
	using the vector type.

	* cc-mode.texi: Documented the new vector setting for offsets.

Mon Oct 02 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-vars.el (c-electric-paren, c-cleanup-list):
	Implemented two new cleanups `space-before-funcall' and
	`compact-empty-funcall'.

	* cc-mode.texi: Documented the two new cleanups
	space-before-funcall and compact-empty-funcall on
	c-cleanup-list.

Sun Oct 01 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-paren-re, c-identifier-re): Two new macros for
	helping building regexps.

	* cc-engine.el (c-on-identifier): New function for detecting
	identifiers.  It takes keywords into account.

	* cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el: Added regexps for complete keyword
	lists.  `c-keywords' is set to a regexp matching all keywords
	in the current language.

Tue Sep 26 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Added '#' to the
	list of characters to skip backwards over at the beginning of
	a statement, since it can precede string literals in Pike.

Thu Aug 31 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-guess-fill-prefix): Fixed bug with prefix
	recognition when standing on the last line in a C++ comment
	with nothing but whitespace after the prefix.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-to-start-of-if): Fixed bug when
	given no limit argument.

Wed Aug 30 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): Fixed brace list
	recognition for the `[]= operator symbol in Pike.

Sat Aug 26 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-bytecomp.el (cc-eval-when-compile): New macro that works
	around a bug in `eval-when-compile' in the byte compiler.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-token-1): Fixed bug with return
	value when count is zero and there's no token start within the
	limit.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Don't add 'comment-intro to lines with
	"prefix comments", i.e. comments which are followed by code on
	the same line.

	* cc-mode-19.el: Fixes so that checks that must be done at
	compile time also are done then.

Fri Aug 25 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el: Make sure cc-mode-19 is loaded both at compile
	time and at runtime, and only when it's needed.

Sun Aug 20 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Major cleanup for less error prone and more warning free
	compilation, including some fixes for bugs due to different
	compilation orders. Thanks to Martin Buchholz for providing
	the basis for all this.

	cc-bytecomp.el: New file that provides some byte compilation
	features: It ensures that files always are loaded from the
	current source directory during compilation, and it provides a
	set of macros to turn off specific compiler warnings for
	specific symbols.  (It's not CC Mode specific in any way.)

	Fixed a nearly acyclic dependency tree (both runtime and
	compile-time) between all files.

	cc-defs.el: Separated all macros before the inline functions,
	to ensure correct compilation.

	cc-defs.el, cc-engine.el: Moved c-beginning-of-macro to from
	cc-defs.el to cc-engine.el and made it a function instead.

	cc-mode-19.el: Patch the byte compiler in Emacs 19 not to warn
	about char-after.

	cc-vars.el: Cope even when there isn't a custom package
	containing defcustom available.

	cc-make.el: Removed since it's no longer necessary.

	README: Updated installation instructions.

Mon Aug 14 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el: Moved around things to
	improve the modularity: Moved all mode init stuff from
	cc-langs.el to cc-mode.el, including the keymap
	initialization; cc-langs now only contains the various
	variables for configuring the language syntax.

	* cc-engine.el, cc-styles.el (c-evaluate-offset,
	c-get-offset): Moved from cc-styles to cc-engine since file
	dependency analysis suggests they belong there (which also
	makes more sense).  Thanks to Martin Buchholz for doing the
	analysis.

Sat Aug 12 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fn-region-is-active-p): New function that
	wraps the corresponding macro, for use in places that aren't
	compiled.  Thanks to Martin Buchholz for pointing out this.

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-menu): Use c-fn-region-is-active-p.

	* cc-mode.el (c-prepare-bug-report-hooks): Hook variable to
	add things to the bug report.

Mon Aug 07 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-guess-fill-prefix): Fixed bug where the
	returned prefix could contain a newline when the search for a
	good prefix line failed.

Sun Aug 06 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-toggle-auto-state, c-toggle-hungry-state,
	c-toggle-auto-hungry-state): Made the argument optional, as
	the documentation says it is.

Sat Aug 05 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Don't treat the Pike
	multiline string syntax, #"...", as a cpp macro.

Mon Jul 10 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Release 5.27

Sun Jul 09 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): Replaced a call to
	c-beginning-of-statement-1 that caused a bad case of recursion
	which could consume a lot of CPU in large classes in languages
	that have in-expression classes (i.e. Java and Pike).

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Check for in-expression
	statements before top level constructs (i.e. case 6 is moved
	before case 5 and is now case 4) to catch in-expression
	classes in top level expressions correctly.

Sun Jul 02 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Less naive handling of
	objc-method-intro. Case 4 removed and case 5I added.

	* cc-langs.el (c-append-paragraph-start): New variable used by
	c-common-init to get paragraph-start correct.
	* cc-langs.el (c-common-init): Use c-append-paragraph-start to
	initialize paragraph-start to make it correct both with and
	without the javadoc special case.

	* cc-mode.el (java-mode): Use c-append-paragraph-start to
	initialize paragraph-start for javadoc markup.

	* cc-vars.el (c-style-variables-are-local-p): Incompatible
	change by defaulting this to t.  It's motivated by the
	confusing behavior that otherwise arise from the style system
	when editing both java and non-java files at the same time
	(see the comments about style setting in c-common-init).

Tue Jun 20 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-new-comment-line): Added a kludge
	similar to the one in c-fill-paragraph to check the fill
	prefix from the adaptive fill function for sanity.

Mon May 01 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-end-of-defun-1): Fixed forward scanning into
	defun block.

Sun Mar 19 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi Documented the change of cpp-macro.

Tue Mar 14 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-multi-inher): Handle lines with
	leading comma nicely. Extended to handle member initializers
	too.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-inheritance-list,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed recognition of inheritance lists
	when the lines begins with a comma.

	* cc-mode.texi Updated doc for c-lineup-multi-inher.

	* cc-vars.el (c-offsets-alist): Changed default for
	member-init-cont to c-lineup-multi-inher since it now handles
	member initializers and indents better for leading commas.

Sun Mar 12 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Fixed some bugs in the state
	handling that caused class open lines to be recognized as
	statement-conts in some cases.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-new-comment-line): Keep the fill prefix
	guessed by the adaptive fill function unless point is on the
	first line of a block comment.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-syntactic-ws): Fixed an infloop bug
	when the buffer ends with a macro continuation char.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Added support for
	function definitions as statements in Pike.  The first
	statement in a lambda block is now labeled defun-block-intro
	instead of statement-block-intro.

	* cc-engine.el (c-narrow-out-enclosing-class): Whack the state
	so that the class surrounding point is selected, not the one
	innermost in the state.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug in
	recognition of switch labels having hanging multiline
	statements.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-member-init-list): Broke out
	some code in c-guess-basic-syntax to a separate function.
	* cc-engine.el (c-just-after-func-arglist-p): Fixed
	recognition of member inits with multiple line arglists.
	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): New case 5B.3 to detect
	member-init-cont when the commas are in funny places.

Thu Mar 09 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-auto-newline): Removed this macro since it's
	not used anymore.

	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-bos): New helper function.
	* cc-engine.el (c-looking-at-inexpr-block): More tests to tell
	inexpr and toplevel classes apart in Pike.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bogus recognition
	of case 9A.

	* cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el (c-Pike-inexpr-class-key): New
	constant, since "class" can introduce an in-expression class
	in Pike nowadays.

Sun Feb 06 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-gnu-impose-minimum): Don't impose minimum
	indentation on cpp-macro lines.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Made the cpp-macro
	a syntax modifier like comment-intro, to make it possible to
	get syntactic indentation for preprocessor directives.  It's
	incompatible wrt to lineup functions on cpp-macro, but it has
	no observable effect in the 99.9% common case where cpp-macro
	is set to -1000.

Sat Feb 05 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug with missed
	member-init-cont when the preceding arglist is several lines.

Sat Jan 29 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): The basic offset for the BSD
	style corrected to 8.

Sun Jan 16 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): Adjusted the indentation of
	brace list openers in the gnu style.

Sun Jan 09 2000  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-command): Obey c-syntactic-indentation.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace, c-electric-slash,
	c-electric-star, c-electric-semi&comma, c-electric-colon,
	c-electric-lt-gt, c-electric-paren): Don't reindent old lines
	when c-syntactic-indentation is nil.

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Fixed bug where
	we were left at comments preceding the first statement when
	reaching the beginning of the buffer.

	* cc-vars.el (c-syntactic-indentation): New variable to turn
	off all syntactic indentation.

Tue Dec 28 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Keep one or two spaces
	between the text and the block comment ender when it hangs,
	depending on how many there are before the fill.

Sun Dec 19 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-closest-statement): New helper
	function to go back to the closest preceding statement start,
	which could be inside a conditional statement.
	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Use
	c-beginning-of-closest-statement in cases 10B.2, 17B and 17C.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Better handling of
	arglist-intro, arglist-cont-nonempty and arglist-close when
	the arglist is nested inside parens.  Cases 7A, 7C and 7F
	changed.

	* cc-langs.el (c-Java-javadoc-paragraph-start): Brought
	up-to-date with javadoc 1.2.

Fri Dec 17 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Fixed handling of
	multiline Pike type decls.

Tue Dec 14 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-new-comment-line): Always break
	multiline comments in multiline mode, regardless of
	comment-multi-line.

Mon Dec 13 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug with
	fully::qualified::names in C++ member init lists.  Preamble in
	case 5D changed.

Sat Dec 04 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-common-init): Handling of obsolete variables
	moved to c-initialize-cc-mode.  More compatible style override
	when using global style variables.
	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-cc-mode): Handling of obsolete
	variables moved here.

	* cc-mode.texi Documented the special behavior of
	c-special-indent-hook as a style variable.  Don't talk about
	doing (c-make-styles-buffer-local t) in a mode hook, since
	that's already too late to work right.

	* cc-styles.el (c-make-styles-buffer-local): Flag style
	variable localness in c-style-variables-are-local-p to make
	the compatibility measure in c-common-init work well.

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style-1): c-special-indent-hook can no
	longer contain set-from-style.
	* cc-styles.el (c-initialize-builtin-style): Don't check for
	set-from-style on c-special-indent-hook.
	* cc-styles.el (c-copy-tree): Obsolete.  The standard function
	copy-alist is sufficient now.

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style, c-set-style-1,
	c-get-style-variables): Fixes to variable initialization so
	that duplicate entries in styles have the same effect
	regardless of DONT-OVERRIDE.

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style-2): Fixed bug where the
	initialization of inheriting styles failed when the
	dont-override flag is set.

	* cc-vars.el (c-special-indent-hook): Don't use set-from-style
	on this.

Mon Nov 22 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-forward-comment): Removed the workaround
	introduced in 5.38 since it had worse side-effects.  If a line
	contains the string "//\"", it regarded the // as a comment
	start since the \ temporarily doesn't have escape syntax.

Sun Nov 21 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Release 5.26

Sun Nov 21 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-forward-conditional): Handle an arbitrary
	target depth.  Optionally count #else lines as clause limits,
	as suggested by don provan <provan@lucent.com>.  #elif
	handling fixed.

	* (c-up-conditional-with-else, c-down-conditional,
	c-down-conditional-with-else): New commands that uses the
	added functionality in `c-forward-conditional'.

	* cc-mode.texi: Documented the new up/down preprocessor
	conditional function varieties.

Tue Nov 09 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Updated for all the new features and
	proofread.  Major changes:
	o  All text filling and line breaking issues is collected in a
	   new top-level chapter.  The section on auto-fill mode
	   interaction have been incorporated into this.
	o  The list of the standard lineup functions is expanded with
	   better explanations and examples.  It's moved to a
	   top-level chapter since it's hard to find under Customizing
	   Indentation / Advanced Customizations / Custom Indentation
	   Functions.
	o  The sections on Permanent Customization and Styles are
	   mostly rewritten due to the changes in the style system.
	   The part about the mode hooks has gotten an own section.

Tue Oct 26 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-comment): Preserve the alignment with
	a comment on the previous line instead of preserving the
	comment-column.

Sun Sep 26 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Fixes to IDL mode after input from Eric Eide
	<eeide@cs.utah.edu>:
	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Allow
	`c-conditional-key' to be nil, for the benefit of IDL mode.
	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Ditto.
	cc-langs.el (C-IDL-class-key): Fixed.  Don't match `class'
	but do match CORBA 2.3 `valuetype'.
	* cc-langs.el (c-IDL-access-key): New defconst.  Should be nil
	for IDL.
	* cc-langs.el (c-IDL-conditional-key): New defconst.  Should
	be nil for IDL.
	* cc-langs.el (c-IDL-comment-start-regexp): New defconst.
	Like C++.
	* cc-mode.el (idl-mode): Use new `c-IDL-*' defconsts.  Also,
	set `c-method-key' and `c-baseclass-key' to nil.

Wed Aug 25 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression): Match classes
	with nonhanging open braces.

Sun Aug 15 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el: Added docstrings to all lineup functions.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-java-throws): Handle a hanging throws
	keyword.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-C-comments): Handle free form text
	comments.  Use c-comment-prefix-regexp and comment-start-skip
	instead of hardcoded regexps.

Sat Aug 14 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-defun, c-end-of-defun): Fixed eob
	behavior and return value as documented.

Sat Jul 31 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Changes for new style variable init system:
	* cc-langs.el (c-common-init): Dito.
	* cc-styles.el: c-offsets-alist moved to cc-vars.el since it's
	now customizable.
	* cc-vars.el: Style variables may now take a value
	'set-from-style to make them take their value from the style
	system. This value is now the default on all these variables.
	* cc-vars.el (c-valid-offset): New function to verify a
	syntactic symbol offset setting.
	* cc-vars.el (c-offsets-alist): Variable moved from
	cc-styles.el since it's now customizable in a similar way to
	the other style variables.
	* cc-vars.el (c-old-style-variable-behavior): New variable to
	revert to the old style init behavior.

	* cc-vars.el (c-hanging-comment-starter-p,
	c-hanging-comment-ender-p): These variables are now obsolete and
	therefore removed.

	* cc-vars.el (c-file-style, c-file-offsets): Made always
	buffer local.

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression): Don't match
	the throws clause that might follow the function prototype in
	C++.

Sat Jul 24 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-beginning-of-macro): Fixed bug where point
	could move forward for macros that doesn't start in column 0.

Thu Jul 08 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-indent-multi-line-block,
	c-lineup-whitesmith-in-block): Two new lineup functions for
	use in whitesmith style.

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): More fixes to whitesmith
	style.  It should now handle all different braces uniformly in
	both hanging and non-hanging cases.

Wed Jul 07 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Documented the default behavior when a symbol
	doesn't exist on c-hanging-braces-alist.

Mon Jul 05 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-exp): Use a marker to save point to
	make it stay in the same position relative to the surrounding
	text.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Force the line comment prefix
	when adaptive-fill-mode doesn't manage to get it correct.

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-java-generic-expression): Handle types
	with dotted notation, e.g. foo.bar.Gnu.

	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-cc-mode): Wrap all function calls
	within unwind-protect (previously only some were wrapped so it
	would be possible to register mode initialization when full
	initialization did not finish).

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): Corrected the brace placement
	in the whitesmith style.  Thanks to Sean Luke
	<seanl@cs.umd.edu>.  Also extended the bsd and whitesmith
	styles with consistent brace placement for all constructs.

Sun Jul 04 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-context-line-break): Continue C++ comments too
	when point is in the middle of them.

	* cc-cmds.el: Line breaking and paragraph filling code
	rewritten:
	(c-guess-fill-prefix): New function that uses various
	heuristics to guess the comment prefix.
	(c-fill-paragraph): Rewritten to use `c-guess-fill-prefix'.
	It now assumes adaptive filling is active to preserve the line
	prefix inside comments.
	(c-indent-new-comment-line): Replacement for the now
	obsolete `c-comment-line-break-function' that uses
	`c-guess-fill-prefix' when appropriate.  It now observes the
	setting of `comment-multi-line', which has effect in C-style
	block comments.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-context-line-break): New function intended to
	be put on RET.  It's essentially `newline-and-indent', but
	continues C block comments with the appropriate line prefix.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-do-auto-fill): New function put on
	`normal-auto-fill-function' to implement the
	`c-ignore-auto-fill' variable.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement): Use
	`c-comment-prefix-regexp' to avoid ending up inside the
	comment prefix.  Better handling of comment starters and
	enders. Catch comments better when traversing code.  Stop at
	preprocessor directives.

	* cc-defs.el (c-forward-comment): New subst to hide platform
	dependent quirks in `forward-comment'.

	* cc-engine.el (c-literal-limits): Added NOT-IN-DELIMITER
	argument.
	(c-literal-limits-fast): Implemented NEAR and NOT-IN-DELIMITER
	arguments. Activate this function by default when
	`parse-partial-sexp' supports it (currently Emacs 20.x).

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Anchor the `c' syntax
	on the comment opener to make constants usable as lineup
	arguments.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-C-comments): Fixes to handle the
	changed anchor position in the `c' syntactic symbol.  Handle
	more than stars in the comment prefix; use the new variable
	`c-comment-prefix-regexp'.  Don't indent text not preceded by
	a comment prefix to the right of the comment opener if it's
	long.

	* cc-langs.el: Fixes to mode initialization for new line
	breaking and paragraph filling method.  Adaptive fill mode is
	now activated at startup instead of deactivated.  The
	variables used for adaptive filling and paragraph movement are
	also changed to incorporate the value of
	`c-comment-prefix-regexp'.  `substitute-key-definition' is
	used to override some functions in the global map instead of
	overriding their default bindings.

	* cc-mode.el (java-mode): Modify `paragraph-start' for the
	javadoc markup at mode init.

	* cc-mode.el (c-setup-filladapt): A new convenience function
	to configure Kyle E. Jones' Filladapt mode for CC Mode.  This
	function is intended to be used explicitly by the end user
	only.

	* cc-vars.el (c-comment-prefix-regexp): New variable used to
	recognize the comment fill prefix inside comments.
	(c-block-comment-prefix): New name for
	`c-comment-contiuation-stars', which is now obsolete.  It's
	generalized to handle any character sequence.
	(c-ignore-auto-fill): New variable used to selectively disable
	Auto Fill mode in specific contexts.

Tue Jun 29 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-indent): Leave at least one space
	between the comment and the last nonblank character in the
	case where we look at the indentation of the comment on the
	previous line (case 4).

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Added ``' to the
	list of characters that may start a statement (it's a sort of
	prefix operator in Pike, and isn't used at all in any of the
	other languages).

Tue Jun 15 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Report brace list opens
	inside continued statements as statement-cont instead of
	brace-list-open.  The reason is that one normally adjusts
	brace-list-open for brace lists as top-level constructs, and
	brace lists inside statements is a completely different
	context.  Case 10B.2 changed.  Also changed (the somewhat
	esoteric) case 9A to cope with this.

Sat May 29 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Added electric handling of
	the open brace for brace-elseif-brace.

Thu May 27 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-with-syntax-table): New macro to easily switch
	syntax tables temporarily.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Handle template and
	member init argument lists split over several lines.  Case 5D
	changed.

	* cc-langs.el (c-Java-javadoc-paragraph-start): Added new tag
	@throws introduced in Javadoc 1.2.

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-java-generic-expression): Applied
	patch from RMS to avoid infinite backtracking.

Sun May 16 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-arglist): Handle "arglists" surrounded
	by [ ].

Sat May 15 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-dont-change): Compensate properly for
	the column in langelem.

	* cc-engine.el (c-syntactic-information-on-region): New
	function to help debugging the syntactic analysis.

Mon May 03 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-template-args): Handle nested template
	arglists.

	* cc-langs.el (c++-template-syntax-table): New syntax table
	that makes `<' and `>' parenthesis characters, which is useful
	to switch to temporarily when analyzing template arglists.

	* cc-styles.el: Changed default alignment of labels in the
	java style to conform to the examples in the Java Language
	Specification.

	* cc-styles.el (c-offsets-alist): Use `c-lineup-template-args'
	by default.

Fri Mar 12 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Pike allows a comma
	immediately before the closing paren in an arglist, so don't
	check that in Pike mode.  Case 7A changed.

Sat Mar 06 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-region): Fixed bug where comment-only
	lines were ignored under certain conditions.

Fri Mar 05 1999  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-template-args): New function for
	aligning continued template argument lists.

	template-args-cont didn't get recognized when the first
	arglist opener line doesn't contain a template argument.  New
	case 5K.

	whether you're at a toplevel statement or not.

Tue Dec 22 1998  Barry A. Warsaw  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function): It is possible
	that forward-line does not land us at the bol, say if we're on
	the last line in a file.  In that case, do a
	back-to-indentation instead of a forward-comment -1.

Fri Dec 11 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Don't catch

	major-mode checking.

	* cc-cmds.el, cc-engine.el, cc-lang.el: All major-mode
	checking is now spelled (c-major-mode-is 'mode)

Mon Oct 23 1998  Barry A. Warsaw  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-indent): CASE 3: the looking-at should
	match against c-comment-start-regexp instead of comment-start.

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): Further
	dekludgification.  When in C++ mode and searching to see if
	we're in a template definition, don't get tripped up by
	#include <thing.h> syntax!

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report): Add comment-column to list
	of variables reported.

Mon Oct 20 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-vars.el (c-default-style): Slightly different default
	semantics when the value is an alist, and there's a new
	special symbol in the choices: `other'.  This is used when the
	major-mode is not specifically listed.

Wed Oct 14 22:34:50 1998  Barry A. Warsaw  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* Release 5.24

Thu Oct 08 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Added inexpr-class-open and
	inexpr-class-close handling.

	* cc-vars.el (c-hanging-braces-alist): Added inexpr-class-open and
	inexpr-class-close and changed the default setting for those two.

Wed Oct 07 1998  Barry Warsaw  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-delete): Use function delete-forward-p if
	it exists.  This is the blessed XEmacs 21 way of checking for this
	condition.

	Emacs, regardless of whether region highlighting
	(e.g. zmacs-regions / transient-mark-mode) is turned on.

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-menu): Use c-region-is-active-p so
	appropriate menu entries are active correctly across all
	X/Emacsen.

	* cc-vars.el Added definition of `other' widget type, which allows
	any value other than t or nil, but doesn't let the user type in
	any old thing.  This is used in c-tab-always-indent as per Per's
	recommendation.

Fri Aug 28 1998  Barry Warsaw  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-use-java-style): Removed as obsolete.

	(c-common-init): Implement the new semantics for
	c-default-style. Should be backwards compatible with old behavior,
	but allow for per-major-mode setting of the default style.

	* cc-mode.el (java-mode): No longer hard code the style setting to
	"java" style. This is now all handled by the new semantics for
	c-default-style.

	* cc-styles.el (c-initialize-builtin-style): No longer call
	c-set-style to set the default style.  This is all handled by the
	new semantics for c-default-style.

	* cc-vars.el (c-default-style): This variable can now take either
	a string or an association list, mapping major mode symbols to
	style names.  Update the docstring to describe the new interface,
	and elaborate the Custom widget to accept either type.

Thu Aug 27 1998  Barry Warsaw  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-offsets-alist): The offset for a syntactic
	symbol can now also be a list, which is recursively evaluated
	using the previous semantics. The first non-nil value succeeds.

	(c-get-offset, c-evaluate-offset): Function to implement recursive
	evaluation for when a symbol's offset is a list (the first one to
	return a non-nil value succeeds -- should this be a stricter check
	for an integer return value?).  Factored out of c-get-offset.

	(c-set-offset, c-read-offset): Error message indicates value could
	be a list.  In former function, add listp check.

	* cc-vars.el (c-strict-syntax-p): Describe addition responsibilities.

Mon Aug 24 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p, c-guess-basic-syntax): In
	Java brace lists may follow the new operator.  Do not recognize
	them as in-expression statements.  Case 7B changed in
	c-guess-basic-syntax.

Sun Jun 07 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1, c-guess-basic-syntax):
	Fixed indentation of try-catch-finally blocks nested inside
	if-statements. New case 13 in c-guess-basic-syntax; cases 13-16
	renamed for this. New syntactic symbol catch-clause.

	* cc-styles.el New syntactic symbol catch-clause.  Changed the
	default to not alter the indentation of multiline strings in any
	way.

Sat Jun 06 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-langs.el Added recognition of IDL specific top-level keywords.

Tue May 19 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey,
	c-looking-at-inexpr-block, c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug in
	recognizing anonymous Java classes.  Cleanups in the code that
	handles in-expression brace constructs.

Sun May 03 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): Rewrote the `=' detection
	loop to make it more clear and in some cases a lot
	faster.

	(c-forward-token-1, c-backward-token-1): Use narrowing for limits
	to improve speed when the limit is inside a huge balanced paren.

Mon Apr 27 14:54:33 1998  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.23

	* (c-electric-pound): Do electric stuff only if # is hit at the
	beginning of the line.

Mon Apr 27 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-math): Indent with c-basic-offset if the
	equal sign ends the first line.

Thu Apr 23 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el, cc-cmds.el, cc-compat.el, cc-engine.el: Use
	c-{forward,backward}-sexp instead of {forward,backward}-sexp.

Mon Apr 20 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): Don't recognize operator=()
	method definitions as bracelists.

	c-special-indent-hook iff hook is of length 1 and contains only
	c-gnu-impose-minimum.

Mon Apr 13 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-add-class-syntax): New function that handles all
	inclass and related symbols in one place.  The anchor position of
	inclass has changed in some situations.

Sun Apr 12 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement): Handle blocks inside
	expressions.

Wed Apr 08 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-mark-function): Much better implementation which
	catches all the expected cases.

	(c-end-of-defun): When called programmatically with no arguments,
	arg is nil, so set it to 1.

	* cc-defs.el (c-point): Added 'eod.

Mon Apr 06 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey,
	c-inside-bracelist-p, c-looking-at-inexpr-block,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Support for Java anonymous classes.  New
	case 6D in c-guess-basic-syntax.

	* cc-langs.el, cc-mode.el, cc-styles.el: Support for Java

	inside expressions.

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p, c-looking-at-inexpr-stat,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Added recognition of the gcc extension for
	statements inside expressions.  They're handled as
	`inexpr-statement' now.  Changed cases: 6, 10, 15A, 16E.  New case
	7B; old 7B-F renumbered.

Fri Apr 03 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): Removed brace-list-entry from the
	list of symbols that can be electrified because all cases where
	brace-list-entry was used should now be brace-entry-open's.  Add
	new brace-entry-open to list of braces which can be electrified.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 9C: brace-list-open =>
	brace-entry-open.

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): In "linux" and "python" styles,
	add brace-entry-open to mimic brace-list-open.  Added description
	and entry for brace-entry-open, a new syntactic symbol.

	* cc-vars.el (c-hanging-braces-alist): Added brace-entry-open to
	mimic brace-list-open in default value.  Updated docstring and
	defcustom spec to describe brace-entry-open and remove
	brace-list-entry.

Thu Apr 02 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-inexpr-stat): New lineup function used in
	Pike mode.

	* cc-langs.el: New variables c-lambda-key and
	c-special-brace-lists for Pike.

	* cc-styles.el: New syntactic symbols inlambda, lambda-intro-cont,
	and inexpr-statement for Pike.

	* cc-engine.el: Support for the Pike language.  Handle Pike-style
	brace lists ('({ })', '([ ])', '(< >)') and in-expression
	statements.  New case 6 in c-guess-basic-syntax; CASES >= 6 ARE
	RENAMED because of this.  New functions:
	c-looking-at-special-brace-list, c-looking-at-inexpr-stat,
	c-looking-at-inexpr-stat-backward.

	* cc-mode.el (pike-mode): New function; support for the Pike language.

Tue Mar 31 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function): Insert newline when
	in a string literal.

Fri Mar 27 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-forward-sexp, c-backward-sexp): Implementations of
	replacement defsubst to insulate ourselves from changes to
	forward-sexp and backward-sexp user level command.

	* cc-styles.el (c-read-offset): A better prompt which includes the
	syntactic symbol being changed.

Wed Mar 18 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-indent-line-or-region): New command. Remove `*'
	from interactive spec.

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-menu): Change "Indent Line" to "Indent Line
	or Region".

Mon Mar 16 19:13:24 1998  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.22

Thu Mar 12 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression): Fix to handle
	explicitly specialized template classes.

	* cc-mode.texi: Added a paragraph on
	signal-error-on-buffer-boundary in the Limitations and Known Bugs
	section.

Wed Mar 11 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed bug with member inits
	on the same line as the function header.  Case 5D.1 changed.

Wed Mar 11 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report): Add
	signal-error-on-buffer-boundary to the list of variables that get
	reported.  This is a losing XEmacs variable that breaks many
	things and should never be set by the user.

Fri Mar  6 00:25:29 1998  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.21

Sat Feb 28 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-on-load): Variable removed.

Sat Feb 28 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): Fix for enum test.

Fri Feb 27 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-cc-mode): Moved require's to top level.

Wed Feb 25 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Always keep point in the same
	relative position.  Fill comment before point if there's nothing
	else on the same line.  Fill block comments after code a little
	better.  Try harder to find a good fill-prefix when point is on a
	block comment ender line.  Use c-Java-javadoc-paragraph-start in
	block comments in Java mode.  Leave block comment ender alone when
	c-hanging-comment-ender-p is nil and point is on that line.
	Detect paragraph-separate in multiparagraph comments.  Fix for bug
	that may strip the `*' off `*/' if fill-prefix ends with `*' and
	c-hanging-comment-ender-p is t.  Added filling of multiline string
	literals.  Always return t to disable filling in any unhandled
	area, i.e. actual code where fill-paragraph only mess things up.

Tue Feb 24 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-collect-line-comments): Require same comment
	start column.

	* cc-langs.el Added c-Java-javadoc-paragraph-start for use in
	c-fill-paragraph.

Tue Feb 24 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): Bind fill-paragraph-function to
	nil when calling fill-paragraph to avoid bogus recursion which
	will signal an error.

Sat Feb 21 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixes for nesting of and
	repeated defun-open's inside extern and namespace clauses.  This
	is done by passing a relpos to 'inextern-lang and 'innamespace.
	Also, the relpos in 'defun-open is no longer always bol.  It's
	always bol when on the top level, however.  Changed cases: 5A.5,
	5I, 14A.

Thu Feb 19 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-token-1, c-backward-token-1): New
	functions to move by tokens.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixes for Java 1.1 array initialization
	brace lists.

Tue Feb 17 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode-19.el: Only define the functions if they aren't defined
	already.

Tue Feb 10 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-make.el: Require cc-mode-19 if needed before batch compile,
	because it contains macro definitions that must be defined during
	compilation.

Sun Feb  8 15:30:43 1998  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.20

Wed Feb 04 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode, java-mode): set
	imenu-case-fold-search to nil.

Tue Feb 03 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-postprocess-file-styles): If a file style or file
	offsets are set, make the variables local to the buffer (via
	make-local-variable).

	* cc-styles.el (c-make-styles-buffer-local): Take an optional
	argument which switches between make-variable-buffer-local and
	make-local-variable.  Generalize.

Mon Feb 02 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-close-paren, c-indent-one-line-block): New
	indentation functions.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement, c-end-of-statement): Do
	not move by sentence in strings.  Doc fixes.

	* cc-mode.texi: Document new indentation functions.

Sat Jan 24 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-defs.el (c-point): In XEmacs, use scan-lists +
	buffer-syntactic-context-depth to radically speed up locating
	top-level defun opening brace in some situations.  When the braces
	hang, this can make c-parse-state from between 3 to 60 times
	faster.  When they don't hang, this may be a few percentage points
	slower (not noticeable to me though).  The variable
	c-enable-xemacs-performance-kludge-p toggles the behavior.  This
	change has no effect on Emacs, which lacks the built-in function
	buffer-syntactic-context-depth.

	* cc-mode.texi: Discuss c-enable-xemacs-performance-kludge-p in
	the section on performance.

	* cc-vars.el (c-enable-xemacs-performance-kludge-p): New variable.

Fri Jan 23 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el cc-defs.el cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-defun,
	c-indent-defun, c-parse-state): Use (c-point 'bod) instead of
	beginning-of-defun directly.

Tue Jan 20 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement): Speedup; it's only
	necessary to call `c-literal-limits' once when the function is
	entered.

Mon Jan 19 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-semi&comma-no-newlines-before-nonblanks,
	c-semi&comma-no-newlines-for-oneline-inliners): New functions,
	appropriate for c-hanging-semi&comma-criteria, but not placed on
	that variable by default.

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-base-map): Comment out c-beginning-of-defun
	and c-end-of-defun bindings, since RMS doesn't want these to be
	the default.

	* cc-mode.texi: Describe c-beginning-of-defun and c-end-of-defun.
	Describe the new c-hanging-semi&comma-criteria functions.

Sun Jan 18 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement): Handle multiple C++ line
	comments a little better.

	Almost completely rewritten.  It's now more thorough when handling
	strings and comments and the transitions between them and the
	surrounding code.  The statement parsing is also rewritten because
	`c-{beginning|end}-of-statement-1' does no longer do what we want
	in this function (e.g. c-b-o-s-1 doesn't go into blocks).  It also
	works better for different counts and when sentence-flag is nil.

	* cc-engine.el (c-forward-syntactic-ws, c-backward-syntactic-ws):
	Removed the narrowings which doesn't seem to have much effect.
	Instead a simple check is made against the given limit.  In
	`c-backward-syntactic-ws' this means that there's no need to
	search for bod, which helps up speed quite a lot in some areas.

	(c-collect-line-comments): New function that given the limits of
	one C++ style line comment returns the range for all adjacent line
	comments.  This functionality is moved from the functions
	`c-literal-limits' and `c-literal-limits-fast'.

	(c-literal-limits): New function that finds the start and end pos
	of a comment or string surrounding point.  This function is Emacs
	19.34 compatible and it has a workaround for what seems to be a
	bug in `parse-partial-sexp' when we use an existing state to get
	the state for the very next character.

	(c-literal-limits-fast): A faster variant of `c-literal-limits'
	for newer Emacsen where the state returned from
	`parse-partial-sexp' contains the starting pos of the last
	literal.  This does not contain the workaround described above.
	The function is not yet tested and therefore not in use for now.
	Note that these functions regard the position between the first
	and second char of a comment starter to be part of the comment.
	Although `parse-partial-sexp' (in Emacs 19 anyway) doesn't do
	this, it seems more intuitive to me.  Maybe `c-in-literal' should
	do this too?

Thu Jan 15 1998  Martin Stjernholm  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode-19.el: Added `when' and `unless'.

Thu Jan 15 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): Fixed a few byte compiler
	warnings.

Wed Jan 14 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-defun, c-end-of-defun): New commands
	which mimic the standard built-ins, but do a much better job of
	finding the open brace when it's hung on the right side (as is the
	case with the most common Java style).

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-to-start-of-do): Break infloop for
	illegal code, e.g. when someone types while (TRUE) { at the top of
	a buffer, we shouldn't hang when the { is typed!

Tue Jan 13 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement): When moving forward by
	sentences, because we're either inside or at the start of a
	comment, be sure to limit movement to only within the extent of
	the comment.

Sat Jan 10 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-java-method-key): I really don't remember why
	this was added, but it seems to do more harm than good.  Besides,
	its value was clearly wrong, being inherited from Objective-C.

	* cc-mode.el (java-mode): Set c-method-key to nil.  I don't think
	this is necessary for Java, and besides, the old value was
	inherited from Objective-C which was clearly not right.  With this
	change, all regression tests pass and the example by Bengt
	Martensson also passes:

	class Baz
	{
	    int blah()
	    {
		return 1
		    + 2
		    + 3
		    + foobar()
		    + 5
		    + 6;
	    }
	}

	* cc-mode.texi Add some explanation to "gnu" style and "user"
	style, describing the relationship between these and user
	Customizations.

	* cc-vars.el (c-default-style): Change this back to "gnu" after
	(re-reading old) discussions with RMS.  This may confuse users who
	set variables in the top-level of their .emacs files, or using the
	Custom interface, since those changes will get incorporated into
	the "user" style.  RMS insists, however, that the default style be
	"gnu".

Sun Jan 04 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-colon): Newlines should not be inserted
	before or after scope operators, regardless of the value of
	c-hanging-colons.

	* cc-engine.el (c-backward-to-start-of-if): Workaround a nasty to
	track down bug.  If point is < lim, then this function can
	actually land you forward into the buffer.  This can cause an
	infloop in c-beginning-of-statement-1. It is probably a bug that
	this function gets called with a lim > point, but that's even
	harder to figure out, so if that's the case when this function is
	called, it's simpler just to ignore lim and use bod.  This breaks
	the infloop without causing broken indentation.

Sat Jan 03 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-dont-change): New lineup function that
	leaves the current line's indentation unchanged.  Used for the new
	cpp-macro-cont syntactic symbol.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace): namespace-open and
	namespace-close braces can hang.

	* cc-defs.el (c-emacs-features): Added autoload cookie which Steve
	Baur claims is necessary for XEmacs.

	* cc-engine.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey): When searching up
	for a class key, instead of hardcoding the extended search for
	"extern", use the new variable c-extra-toplevel-key, which is
	language dependent.  For C++, this variable includes the keyword
	"namespace" which will match C++ namespace introducing blocks.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): Support for recognizing C++ namespace
	blocks, by elaborating on the mechanism used to find external
	language blocks.  Searches which hardcoded "extern" now use
	c-extra-toplevel-key, a language dependent variable.  Case clauses
	that were modified: CASE 5A.1, CASE 5A.4, CASE 5F, CASE 5I, CASE
	14A.

	CASE 3: we can now determine whether we're at the beginning of a
	cpp macro definition, or inside the middle of one. Set syntax to
	'cpp-macro in the former case, 'cpp-macro-cont in the latter.  In
	both cases, the relpos is the beginning of the macro.

	(c-forward-syntactic-ws): Added code that skips forward over
	multi-line cpp macros.

	(c-beginning-of-macro): Moved, and made into a defsubst.  This
	function can now actually find the beginning of a multi-line C
	preprocessor macro.

	(c-backward-syntactic-ws): Use c-beginning-of-macro to skip
	backwards over multi-line macro definitions.

	(c-in-literal, c-fast-in-literal): Use c-beginning-of-macro to
	find out whether we're in a multi-line macro definition.

	* cc-langs.el (c-C-extra-toplevel-key, c-C++-extra-toplevel-key,
	c-extra-toplevel-key): New variables which parameterize the search
	for additional top-level enclosing constructs.  In all languages,
	extern lang blocks are supported (but maybe this should just be C
	and C++?). In C++, also namespace blocks are supported.

	* cc-menus.el Imenu patches by Masatake Yamato and Jan Dubois.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode): Set c-extra-toplevel-key to
	c-C++-extra-toplevel-key.

	(c-initialize-on-load): New variable, *not* customized.  When set
	to t -- the default -- c-initialize-cc-mode is called when the
	cc-mode.el file is loaded, e.g. via (require 'cc-mode).  This is
	backwards compatible with .emacs files that used CC Mode 4.  I'm
	still not 100% sure this is the right thing to do.

	* cc-mode.texi: Added descriptions of the new C++ namespace
	syntactic symbols: namespace-open, namespace-close, innamespace.
	Added an example for this and also multi-line macros.

	Describe c-lineup-dont-change and the new cpp-macro-cont syntactic
	symbol.  Remove the `known limitation' that multi-line macros
	aren't supported.

	* cc-styles.el (c-offsets-alist): Three new syntactic symbols:
	innamespace, namespace-open, namespace-close.  These support C++
	namespace blocks.

	Added new syntactic symbol cpp-macro-cont, by default bound to
	c-lineup-dont-change.  This symbol is assigned to subsequent lines
	of a multi-line C preprocess macro definition.

	* cc-vars.el (c-default-style): Variable is user customizable so
	it's docstring should start with a `*'.

Fri Jan 02 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-fast-in-literal): Function which should be
	faster than c-in-literal.  This uses buffer-syntactic-context
	which is a speedy built-in that exists only in XEmacs.  Make it's
	alias conditional on that built-in's existance.  To be honest, the
	performance effects should be tested.  Also c-fast-in-literal
	knows about multi-line cpp macros while c-in-literal does not.
	The latter should be taught about this, but this change will wait
	for a future mega-patch to handle multi-line macros.

Thu Jan 01 1998  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function): When breaking a
	line-oriented comment, copy the comment leader from the previous
	line instead of hardcoding it to "// ".  This ensures that
	whitespace between the slashes and the text is preserved.

Tue Nov 18 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-base-map): Bind c-mark-function using a
	portable representation of C-M-h that differentiates this from
	M-BS on both XEmacs and Emacs.

Sat Nov 15 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-pound, c-electric-brace,
	c-electric-slash, c-electric-star, c-electric-semi&comma,
	c-electric-colon, c-electric-lt-gt, c-scope-operator,
	c-indent-command, c-indent-exp, c-indent-defun,
	c-backslash-region, c-fill-paragraph): Added "*" to interactive
	spec to barf-if-buffer-read-only.

Fri Nov 14 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph): regexp-quote the fill-prefix when
	search forward for the end of line oriented comments.  This is in
	case the fill-prefix contains regexp special characters
	(e.g. fill-prefix == " //* ")

	(c-backslash-region): Do not preserve the zmacs region (XEmacs).

Wed Nov 12 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-base-map): c-mark-function moved back to
	M-C-h.  RMS says: "It ought to be on M-C-h, because that is the
	key to mark one function definition in whatever language you're
	using."  I don't remember why it was moved in the first place.

Tue Nov 04 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-backspace, c-electric-delete):
	Interactive spec should have a read-only *.

Thu Oct 30 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-styles-alist): Merged "jdk" into "java" style
	and removed "jdk" style.  Only differences now are inline-open and
	c-basic-offset.

Wed Oct 29 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi Document "jdk" style.

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): "jdk" style given by Martin
	Buchholz <mrb@Eng.Sun.COM> for conformance with Sun's JDK style.

Fri Oct 10 1997  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-set-style-2, c-initialize-builtin-style): Don't
	special case "cc-mode", it's a derived style.

	Fix setup of derived style "cc-mode".

	Introduce the new default style "user" which contains all user
	customizations.  The style "cc-mode" is retained as an alias, but
	it's use is deprecated.  The default style variable has been
	renamed c-default-style.

	* cc-vars.el (c-site-default-style): Renamed to c-default-style.
	Also, the default value is now "user".

Mon Oct  6 19:12:51 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.19

Mon Oct  6 19:09:17 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5F: extern-lang-close relpos should be
	element 0 of inclass-p, not element 1.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-progress-init, c-progress-fini):
	Be slient if c-progress-interval
	is nil.

	* cc-vars.el (c-progress-interval): Document new semantics

Fri Oct  3 23:10:04 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	Watch out for keywords which have a
	preceding underscore.

Fri Sep 26 23:30:58 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-menus.el: Patches to Imenu support given by
	"Masatake (jet) YAMATO" <masata-y@is.aist-nara.ac.jp>.
	(Jan Dubois) jan.dubois@ibm.net

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function):
	Fix for when comment starts at
	comment-column and there is non-whitespace preceding this on the
	current line.

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report): Remove c-recognize-knr-p.  Add
	c-comment-continuation-stars.

Mon Sep 22 15:47:02 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-initialize-builtin-style):
	Only use copy-tree if it is
	funcall-able.  This is the right patch, and was given by Erik Naggum
	<erik@naggum.no>

Tue Sep 16 19:23:24 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.18

Tue Sep 16 23:17:15 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-c-prototype-macro-regexp): New variable.

	(cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression): Patches to better match C++ code.
	Given by jan.dubois@ibm.net (Jan Dubois)

	* cc-menus.el (cc-imenu-java-generic-expression):
	Removed test for declaration
	statements.  Patch given by Ake Stenhoff <etxaksf@aom.ericsson.se>, as
	forwarded to me by RMS.

	* cc-menus.el:
	Imenu support for Objective-C given by Masatake (jet) YAMATO.

	* cc-mode.el (objc-mode): Bind imenu-create-index-function to
	cc-imenu-objc-function to enable Imenu support for Objective-C.
	Contributed by Masatake (jet) YAMATO.

Mon Sep 15 23:21:51 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-initialize-builtin-style):
	Use existing copy-tree if it's defined.

	copy-sequence doesn't work; the
	c-offsets-alist must be copied recursively.  Use copy-tree solution
	given by Simon Marshall.

Fri Sep  5 04:47:03 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement):
	Fixes in sentence movement to properly
	handle M-e moving forward into a comment when looking at preceding
	whitespace, and M-a moving backward into comment when looking at
	following whitespace.

	Uncommented the looking-at call in the
	sentence-flag clause so that moving by forward-sentence when looking
	at the beginning of a comment works again.  A previous log message in
	cc-mode.el indicates this was commented out "because
	c-beginning-of-statement-1 should do the right thing", but clearly it
	doesn't.

	I don't know if this breaks something else, because I can't figure out
	why it was commented out in the first place.

	* cc-langs.el:
	Define `/' in c-mode-base-map since all modes now support
	c-electric-slash.

	Define C-c C-e in mode-specific maps instead of c-mode-base-map since
	c-expand-macro is meaningless in Java and IDL.

	* cc-engine.el (c-end-of-statement-1):
	Wrap backward-up-list in a c-safe call so no
	error results when buffer contains only a comment and point is at
	eob.

Fri Sep  5 00:50:41 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.17

Fri Sep  5 04:47:03 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement):
	Fixes in sentence movement to properly
	handle M-e moving forward into a comment when looking at preceding

	* cc-langs.el:
	Define `/' in c-mode-base-map since all modes now support

	Define C-c C-e in mode-specific maps instead of c-mode-base-map since
	c-expand-macro is meaningless in Java and IDL.

	* cc-engine.el (c-end-of-statement-1):
	Wrap backward-up-list in a c-safe call so no error results when
	buffer contains only a comment and point is at eob.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-beginning-of-statement):
	Uncommented the looking-at call in the

	I don't know if this breaks something else, because I can't figure out
	why it was commented out in the first place.

Tue Aug 26 22:31:55 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): "python" style, knr-argdecl-intro == +

Mon Aug 25 17:25:12 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-inside-bracelist-p):
	Add a test to the enum list test so that the
	following code won't erroneously recognize as inside a brace list:

	static PyObject **
	unpack_sequence(v, argcnt, why)
	     PyObject **v;
	     int argcnt;
	     enum *why_code;
	{
		int i;

	Otherwise, the `enum' in the K&R decl trips this code up.

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist): "python" style, fill-column = 78

Fri Aug 22 20:25:57 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function):
	Don't break line in the middle of a string.

Mon Aug 18 17:37:24 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist):
	"python" style change: arglist-intro <= +
	"python" style change: inextern-lang <= 0

Fri Aug 15 18:39:10 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist):
	"python" style requires c-comment-continuation-stars
	to be "".

Fri Aug 15 17:26:05 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Release 5.16

Fri Aug 15 18:39:10 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist):
	"python" style requires c-comment-continuation-stars
	to be "".

	* cc-engine.el (c-end-of-statement-1):
	Eliminate false hits on important characters
	inside literals (strings, comments).

Tue Aug 12 21:47:18 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function):
	In this function, and the defadvice,
	call indent-new-comment-line if not in a comment.

	* cc-vars.el (c-buffer-is-cc-mode): Definition moved to cc-mode.el

	* cc-mode.el (c-buffer-is-cc-mode):
	Definition moved here from cc-vars.el.  Also,
	put permanent-local property on variable so it's value won't get
	killed by kill-all-local-variables.  This makes it easier for non-CC
	Mode derived modes to be initialized correctly.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace):
	In preserve-p test, don't test char-before when at
	bobp.  Open brace at bobp is illegal in most modes, but not awk-mode,
	which depends on CC Mode.

Mon Aug 11 15:37:04 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode, java-mode, objc-mode, idl-mode):
	Remove obsolete variable c-double-slash-is-comments-p.

	* cc-langs.el (c-double-slash-is-comments-p): Remove obsolete variable.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph):
	Remove conditional on obsolete variable
	c-double-slash-is-comments-p.

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist):
	Conform comment settings to RMS's preferences.

	objc-mode-syntax-table, idl-mode-syntax-table):	Added autoload
	cookies. c-mode-syntax-table already has one.

Wed Aug  6 21:50:08 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-cc-mode):
	Check all cc-mode-19 interface requirements.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-java-throws):
	Change the `when' clause to an `if-progn' :-(

	* cc-langs.el (c-common-init):
	Make comment-line-break-function buffer local iff it's boundp.

	* cc-cmds.el:
	defadvice for indent-new-comment-line keys off of c-buffer-is-cc-mode
	instead of an explicit major-mode list.  this means non-CC Mode
	derived modes will work properly

	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-cc-mode): Set c-buffer-is-cc-mode to t.

	* cc-vars.el (c-buffer-is-cc-mode): New variable

	* cc-mode.texi:
	In FAQ section, document use of c-mode-base-map instead of c-mode-map.

	* cc-mode.el (c-initialize-cc-mode):
	Give in to the pressure.  require 'cc-mode-19
	if functionp is not bound.  Too many novice errors without this.

	* cc-cmds.el:
	Added advice for indent-new-comment-line so older Emacsen work if they
	don't have the variable comment-line-break-function.

Mon Aug  4 14:55:40 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-base-map, c++-mode-map):
	Move `/' as an electric character
	from c++-mode-map to c-mode-base-map for all languages.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-slash):
	Make this work as the final slash in a */ block
	oriented comment closing token.

	* cc-vars.el (c-comment-continuation-stars):
	Can take a nil value.  Also, the default value is "* ".

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function): nil value for
	c-comment-continuation-stars means use old semantics

Fri Aug  1 22:44:49 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function):
	Added optional soft argument

	* cc-langs.el (c-common-init): Set comment-multi-line and
	comment-line-break-function here for all modes.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode, java-mode, idl-mode):
	Don't set comment-multi-line here.

	* cc-vars.el (c-comment-continuation-stars): New variable

	* cc-cmds.el (c-comment-line-break-function): New function for proposed
	mode-specific comment-line-break-function variable.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode): comment-multi-line => nil

	* cc-mode.texi: Removed the description of c-enable-//-in-c-mode.

	* cc-langs.el (c-C-comment-start-regexp): Obsolete.

	(c-comment-start-regexp): Initialize from c-C++-comment-start-regexp.

	(c-populate-syntax-table, c-setup-dual-comments): Merge both functions
	into c-populate-syntax-table.  With the new 9X draft C standard, both
	line and block oriented comments are supported in all modes, so always
	set up the syntax tables to support both comment styles.

	(c-mode-syntax-table, c++-mode-syntax-table, java-mode-syntax-table,
	objc-mode-syntax-table, idl-mode-syntax-table): Use the new syntax
	table initialization idioms.

	(c-enable-//-in-c-mode): Obsolete.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5D.4: template argument continuation
	lines are now analyzed as template-args-cont.

Fri Jul 25 22:17:07 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	When checking for bare semi, don't match
	on a semi following a close brace, otherwise the following legal code
	fails:

	void foo()
	{
	    static struct Pattern nums
		= {1, 2, 3};

	    int j = 2;
	}

	This might break some bare semi idioms but those are probably more
	rare than static initializers.

	Added uncomment region and slight rearrangement of
	items

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-backspace):

	* cc-engine.el (c-maybe-labelp):
	defvar this to shut up the byte compiler

Wed Jul  9 22:08:58 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-initialize-builtin-style):
	use copy-sequence instead of copy-tree
	so the cl module isn't necessary.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-brace):

	* Release: Don't put release number in tar file

Thu Jul  3 22:54:03 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-base-map):
	Proper binding of c-electric-backspace and
	c-electric-delete, based on the policy of the various maintainers.
	Thank goodness for delete-key-deletes-forward!

	Minor changes to the
	cutomize format.

	* cc-mode.texi: Fixed spelling of Texinfo

	(c-parse-state): When an unbalanced close brace is discovered, don't
	raise an error (prevents insertion of character).  Insert the
	character, display a warning message, and set c-parsing-error so
	syntax echoing will be disabled.

	(c-show-syntactic-information, c-indent-line): Suppress syntax echoing
	if c-parsing-error is non-nil.

	* cc-styles.el: Added require of cl to pick up definition of copy-tree.

Mon Jun 30 21:41:00 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	Moved
	defvars from cc-langs.el to cc-mode.el for use in c-mode, c++-mode,
	objc-mode, and java-mode docstrings.  Actual population of these mode
	maps remains in cc-langs.el.

	* cc-mode.el:
	Require cc-langs at top level, so as to get the definitions for
	c-mode-map, et al. that are used in the *-mode docstrings.

Fri Jun 27 17:33:32 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-syntax-table):
	Added autoload cookie for gdb-mode.

Thu Jun 26 21:12:56 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5H: Whack one ebola infection (e.g. using
	memq with the results of following-char in XEmacs 20).

	* cc-styles.el:
	Added two require's that make autoload call of (c-set-style) work.

Fri Jun 20 20:40:33 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode, java-mode):
	Make sure to call
	c-update-modeline after the hooks are run, so that the modeline
	accurately reflects auto-newline and delete-key minor modes if the
	hooks set c-hungry-delete-key or c-auto-newline directly.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-java-throws): Fixed some regressions.

Fri Jun 20 19:55:55 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Public Release 5.11

	* cc-mode.texi:
	Describe changes to support separation of Backspace and Delete in
	XEmacs 20.

	* cc-vars.el (c-delete-function): renamed to c-backspace-function.

	(c-backspace-function): New variable.

	* cc-cmds.el (c-electric-backspace, c-electric-delete):
	Old X/Emacs 19 behavior
	typically bound to the backspace keysym is renamed to
	c-electric-backspace (which consults c-backspace-function).
	c-electric-delete (c-delete-function) is now bound to the delete
	keysym, which in XEmacs 20 is separated.

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-base-map):
	No longer bind "\177" as a way to spell [delete]
	and [backspace].  Bind these two keys separate to support XEmacs 20's
	separation of forward deletion and backward deleteion.  This means
	that in Emacs 19 and XEmacs 19, the backspace keysym is now bound to
	c-electric-backspace, but the functionality is the same (although the
	variable this consults is now called c-backspace-function).

	* cc-engine.el (c-show-syntactic-information): Minor optimization.

Tue Jun 17 03:21:50 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-multi-inher): Fixed small order dependency

	* cc-align.el (c-langelem-col):
	New defsubst.  Convert all appropriate calls
	calculating the column of the langelem's relpos to use this function.

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-java-throws): New function

	* cc-styles.el (c-style-alist):
	"java" style's func-decl-cont is associated with
	c-lineup-java-throws so long throws lines line up exceptions.

	* cc-styles.el (c-offsets-alist):
	Substituted RMS's description of func-decl-cont,
	with a minor change.

	* cc-mode.texi:
	Substituted RMS's description of func-decl-cont, with a minor change.

Thu Jun 12 13:57:35 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-styles-alist):
	Changed topmost-intro-cont offset to + in Java
	style.  This is closer to what people expect for default instance
	variable initializations.

Wed Jun 11 18:20:59 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: LFD => C-j

	RMS> I've decided to mostly stop using LFD as the name of an input
	RMS> character because PCs do not have a linefeed key.  So please
	RMS> change the cc-mode manual to use @kbd{C-j} rather than @key{LFD}.

Mon Jun  9 15:20:10 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-styles.el (c-offsets-alist): A few minor changes to the docstring.

Sun Jun  1 16:23:11 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-load-all): cc-menus depends on cc-langs.

	* cc-langs.el (c-mode-base-map):
	New variable.  All maps, including c-mode-map
	inherit from this map.  This makes menu creation more straightforward
	for Emacs, although it is unnecessary for XEmacs.

	(c-make-inherited-keymap): Use c-mode-base-map as the parent map.

Sat May 31 17:35:55 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-langs.el (c-common-init):
	Conversion to the easymenu library for creation of
	popup and menubar menus.

	* cc-menus.el:
	Conversion to the easymenu library for creation of popup and menubar
	menus.

	* cc-mode.el (c-emacs-features): Make this work for Emacsen after
	19.34.

Fri May 30 15:38:09 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-emacs-features):
	Change the XEmacs 19 test from vectorp to arrayp,
	since we're using aref to access an element.  Use this test also
	for Emacs 19, with a few key differences: the element returned in
	Emacs 19 is a cons cell.  Also, arrayp doesn't return t for
	char-tables in Emacs 19.34, but will in Emacs 19.35.

Tue May 27 21:23:51 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5C.3: changing looking-at regexp to
	throws[ \t\n]

	CASE 15E: if we're in Java and looking at the throws clause that
	follows a method's parameter list, we need to go back to the beginning
	of the statement to find the start of the method.

Fri May 23 14:58:30 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Beta Release 5.07

	* cc-vars.el: Added a require of the custom library, for Emacs
	19.34 compatibility.

Thu May 22 22:53:25 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi:
	Document the new default for c-style-variables-are-local-p.  This
	variable is now nil by default.

	* cc-styles.el (c-make-styles-buffer-local):
	New function.  By default all style
	variables are now global in value.  Call this function to make them
	buffer local.  This function is called automatically at load time if
	c-style-variables-are-local-p is non-nil.

	* cc-vars.el (c-style-variables-are-local-p): Default value is now nil.

Tue May 20 23:59:19 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-menus.el (c-popup-menu): Obsolete.

	(c-mode-menu): Optional argument to add " Mode Commands" to the
	title, in XEmacs only.

	* cc-langs.el (c-common-init):
	Get rid of the pre-XEmacs-19.10 way of doing popup
	menus.  Make sure that in XEmacs, the menubar title is just the
	modename, but the popup has "MODENAME Mode Commands".

Tue May 13 22:57:24 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-align.el (c-lineup-C-comments):
	Fixes to handle all situations where the first line of a block
	comment has more stars on it than subsequent lines.  This not only
	picks up the Javadoc style, but also

	/*********************************************************************
	 * Routines formerly in objectPalette.c
	 *********************************************************************/

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 6A: Removed tests for ObjC & Java method
	closing parens since none of the test cases touched this code, and it
	broke close-paren on a separate line being recognized as
	arglist-close.

	* cc-langs.el:
	Removed most byte-compiler warnings by removing many obsolete
	variables.

Fri May  9 21:54:27 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-cmds.el (c-fill-paragraph):
	Included franl@world.std.com (Francis Litterio)
	patch that makes c-fill-paragraph preserve fill-prefix.

	* cc-engine.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 6C: when checking for a `for' statement,
	watch out for underscore separated symbols: for_each

Tue May  6 23:18:13 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Restructuring completed for version 5.xx

Tue May  6 19:16:48 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist, c-set-style-1): Added support for

	* Public Release 4.389.

Fri Mar 28 16:48:31 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5C: watch out for Java abstract method
	definitions.  These are distinguished from normal throws clauses since
	they cross statement boundaries.

Tue Mar 25 03:19:17 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5A.3: use boi instead of bol.

Thu Mar 20 16:46:13 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-Java-comment-start-regexp):
	Recognize the three Java styles of
	comments: 1) traditional C block; 2) javadoc style /** ...; 3) C++
	style.

	(java-mode): Set buffer local variable c-comment-start-regexp to
	c-Java-comment-start-regexp.

	(c-fill-paragraph): Use c-comment-start-regexp derived regular
	expression when checking for c-hanging-comment-starter-p, so javadoc
	styles are handled correctly in Java mode.

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-C-comments):
	Change the re-search-forward to a looking-at in
	the innermost test.  This catches these styles of comments:

	/* Test for garbage collection. If the pool's free size is greater thaasds asdf
	   asdf asdf asdf asdf asd fas fa asdf asf asdf asdf adf asdf asdf asdf asdf
	   asdf glob chob stillp nasty toes winko stagilly frankly sut sut hoey */
	  =!=

	* cc-mode.el (c-add-syntax):
	Move macro definition to before it's first use.

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report):
	capture buffer local variable values which are
	printed in the post-hook, while the current buffer is the CC Mode
	buffer we're interested in.  reporter-submit-bug-report leaves the
	current buffer as the mail buffer, so buffer local variables will not
	get the proper value.

Tue Mar 18 16:43:13 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-inher-key):
	Require the regexp group that contains the `:'.
	Previously it was optional, but that broke other code.

Sun Mar 16 16:17:57 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-fill-paragraph):
	Do not set fill-prefix to "*" when looking-at
	"*/", otherwise the following example does not fill properly (the last
	start gets deleted).

	/* this is a comment
	 */

Mon Mar 10 16:25:49 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-C-comments):

Mon Feb 24 22:49:43 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5B.1: watch out for throw() clauses which
	could follow a member init list in a constructor.

Thu Feb 20 19:32:20 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report):
	Display c-indentation-style, but not in the
	setq.

	* cc-mode.el (c-Java-special-key):
	New variable recognizes Java "implements",
	"extends", and "throws" keywords.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5C: recognize Java constructs
	"implements", "extends", and "throws"; CASE 5C.3: differentiate
	between "throws" == func-decl-cont, and "implements" or "extends" ==
	inher-intro or inher-cont; CASE 5D.3: removed; CASE 5D.4 => 5D.3;
	CASE 5D.5 => CASE 5D.4; CASE 5D.6 => CASE 5D.5; CASE 5K: don't need to
	look for Java keywords.

	(c-lineup-java-inher): Better indentation calculation for Java
	inheritance constructs.

Wed Feb 19 23:29:00 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Beta Release 4.372.

Thu Feb 20 04:07:11 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-Java-special-key, c-guess-basic-syntax,
	c-lineup-java-inher): Recognize Java "extends", "implements", and
	"throws" clauses and map them into 'inher-intro, 'inher-cont, and
	'func-decl-cont syntactic symbols.  Do the indentation as
	of Java inheritance lines better.

Tue Feb 18 03:31:57 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Change documentation to reflect syntactic symbol
	change from 'ansi-funcdecl-cont to 'func-decl-cont.

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist): Changed the syntactic symbol
	'ansi-funcdecl-cont to 'func-decl-cont.  This symbol is useful in
	Java throws declarations.

	(c-lineup-java-inher): New function for lining up "implements"
	continuations (i.e. inheritance in Java).

	(c-style-alist): In "java" style, set 'inher-cont to
	c-lineup-java-inher.

	(c-Java-class-key): Optional c-protection-key can appear before the
	"class" keyword.

Thu Feb 13 21:39:38 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): First, check for bare
	semi-colon, which is a legal statement but not caught by the more
	intense loop later on.

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist): Fixes to "ellemtel" style given by
	Colin Rafferty <craffert@spspme.ml.com>.

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement): Don't use
	forward-sentence when looking at a C block comment start.
	c-beginning-of-statement-1 will do the right thing.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5C: watch for scope operators

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-C-comments): Watch out for no leading stars.

Thu Feb  6 19:07:09 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Document that c-set-style is bound to `C-c .'

	* cc-mode.el (c-set-style): Add initial contents (the value of
	c-indentation-style), and history on the style name.

	(c-mode-map): Bind c-set-style on `C-c .'

	* cc-mode.el (c-read-offset, c-read-offset-history): Use
	completing-read, with REQUIRE-MATCH nil, so that offsets can be
	completed when they are function names.  Also implement read
	history.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 15D: fix infinite loop
	problem in while... clause looking for statement starting at boi,
	when using run-in statement styles.

	* cc-mode.el (cc-imenu-java-generic-expression): New variable for
	integration of java-mode with imenu.

	(java-mode): Use cc-imenu-java-generic-expression.

	* cc-mode.texi: Describe the use of c-hanging-comment-starter-p and
	c-hanging-comment-ender-p, as well as the fill-paragraph command.  In
	the known bugs section, do not recommend using filladapt.

Wed Feb  5 23:50:52 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-hanging-comment-starter-p): New variable,
	analogous to c-hanging-comment-ender-p.

	(c-fill-paragraph): Use c-hanging-comment-starter-p.

Mon Feb  3 16:36:03 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Added a note about c-Java-defun-prompt-regexp in
	the section on performance.

	* cc-mode.el (java-mode): Do not set defun-prompt-regexp to
	c-Java-defun-prompt-regexp.  In the following example, putting
	point on he brace that opens main() and hitting M-C-a will send
	both Emacs 19.34 and XEmacs 19.15 into tight CPU loops.

	-------------------- snip snip --------------------
	import java.io.*;
	import java.lang.*;

	class foo
	{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException, java.io.FileNotFoundException
	    {

		System.out.println(bs.readLine());
	    }
	}

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 2: relpos for 'c and 'c++ is now boi.

Mon Jan 27 18:55:02 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Public Release 4.353

Mon Jan 27 16:25:57 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 15D: do not assume that boi of previous
	statement is the beginning of a statement.

Wed Jan 22 23:42:59 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el:
	Removed the require of imenu.  This currently breaks in XEmacs if you
	have imenu around (which hasn't been completely ported yet), and I
	think it's no longer necessary for Emacs.

Tue Jan 21 20:47:23 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-cleanup-list, c-electric-brace):
	New clean-up option: brace-elseif-brace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-variables-are-local-p):
	New variable which controls whether
	indentation style variable are buffer local are not.  By default, for
	backwards compatibility, this variable is t.

Tue Jan  7 23:53:43 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-Java-access-key):
	set to nil since Java doesn't have C++-like
	access labels.

Mon Jan  6 23:03:21 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi: Document new built-in styles.

Thu Jan  2 21:13:52 1997  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-menu): New function

	(c-popup-menu, c-common-init): use new function to handle XEmacs menus
	better (uses add-submenu where appropriate).

Tue Dec 24 18:55:10 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-C-comments):
	A much better implementation that handles all
	common star-prefixed block comment styles (see below).

	(c-block-comments-indent-p): obsolete and removed.

	int main()
	{
	    /*
	     *
	     */

	    /*

	    **/
	}

	* cc-mode.el (c-indentation-style):
	take default value from c-site-default-style.

	* cc-mode.el (adaptive-fill-regexp):
	For all but XEmacs 19.13, the default should
	be nil.

Thu Dec 19 21:10:35 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-emacs-features): detect Infodock.

	(c-common-init, c-mode-map): Don't install menus for Infodock.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-exp):
	fixed infinite loop when multi-line C comment is last
	thing in buffer.

	(c-guess-basic-offset): fixed error when K&R C-like macro is first
	non-syntactic whitespace in file.

	* cc-mode.el (c-C++-comment-start-regexp):
	use a more efficient representation.

Tue Dec 10 20:32:21 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-buffer-style): New variable.

	* Public Release 4.322

Fri Oct  4 20:28:14 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-backslash-region):
	If a line ends at the end of the region, always
	delete backslash from it.

	Given by Richard Stallman <rms@ethanol.gnu.ai.mit.edu> 1996-08-31

	(c-backslash-region): In XEmacs, keep region active.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	Install FSF mode menu into menubar using the name
	"CC-Mode" for all supported modes.

	(c++-mode-map, objc-mode-map, java-mode-map): Don't install an
	additional FSF menu.

	* cc-mode.el:
	Removed the following variables from the built-in "cc-mode" style:

	    c-echo-syntactic-information-p
	    c-string-syntax-p
	    c-tab-always-indent
	    c-inhibit-startup-warnings-p

	These control how the mode acts, not how code looks.

Mon Sep 30 22:24:48 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-command):
	Sync docstring with texinfo documentation, and
	actual behavior.

Thu Sep 19 18:13:13 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist):
	Added "linux" style.

	* cc-mode.el (c-insert-tab-function):
	New variable allowing tab-to-tab-stop to be
	used instead of insert-tab.

	(c-indent-command): Use c-insert-tab-function variable.

Fri Jun  7 14:31:47 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (java-mode): Use (c-set-style "java"); i.e. lowercase.

	* cc-mode.el (c-functionp):
	Emacs 19.3x doesn't have functionp, so lift the version
	from XEmacs 19.13.

	(c-electric-brace, c-read-offset, c-set-offset, c-get-offset): Use
	c-functionp.

Fri May 31 14:42:07 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist): New syntactic symbols:
	extern-lang-open, extern-lang-close, inextern-lang

	(c-hanging-braces-alist): Hang extern-lang-open by default.

	(c-electric-brace): Add extern-lang-open and extern-lang-close to
	list of symbols that can hang.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5A.4 => 5A.5; New CASE 5A.4 added to
	recognize extern-lang-open; CASE 14C => 14D; New CASE 14C added to
	recognize extern-lang-close

	(c-recognize-knr-p): defconst it.

	(c-search-uplist-for-classkey): When searching for c-class-key,
	concat "\\|extern[^_]".  The logic for determining whether we are
	inclass-p and inextern-p is essentially the same so this seems to
	work very well in all test cases.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): If inclass-p, do an additional check to
	see whether this is really inside an external language definition
	block or a class definition and set inextern-p accordingly (a
	boolean only).

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5A.4 => 5A.1; 5A.1-5A.3 => 5A.2-5A.4;
	New CASE 5F to check for extern-lang-close; CASE 5F-5J => 5G-5K;
	CASE 5I: modifier could either be 'inclass or inextern-lang; CASE
	14A: closing brace isn't an inline-close if we're inside an extern
	language block; CASE 14B: watch out for same.

Thu May 30 14:42:07 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5A.3: an inline-open
	brace should also be given inclass syntax.  The problem is that
	this breaks indentation for brace that start inline-inclass
	functions inside a nested class since they will twice add the
	indentation of the inner class to the running total.

	The solution is to not give one of the two symbols a relpos.  The
	decision was made to omit the relpos of the 'inline-open symbol.

	(c-mode-help-address): Added cc-mode-help@python.org as the new
	address.

	(c-recognize-knr-p, c++-mode, java-mode): Made into a non-user
	configurable variable.  This variable is always t for C and
	Objective-C modes and nil for C++ and Java modes.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5G: Although we still test on
	c-recognize-knr-p, this is no longer user configurable, and no
	longer imposes potentially disasterous impact on performance.
	Adopt c-mode.el assumption that argdecls are indented at least one
	space and that function headers are not indented.  This prevents
	us from potentially searching back to the top of the file when
	looking at a large number of top-level delarations.

	(c-gnu-impose-minimum): New function

	(c-label-minimum-indentation): New buffer-local variable

	(c-style-alist): In "gnu" style, add c-gnu-impose-minimum to
	c-special-indent-hook so case-label and label syntaxes will have a
	minimum indentation.

	(c-submit-bug-report): report on c-label-minimum-indentation

	(c-set-style-1): special case c-special-indent-hook

	make c-special-indent-hook buffer local

Wed May 29 20:13:34 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-skip-conditional): `try' clauses in C++ skip only
	1 sexp.  Also take care of finally and synchronized statements.

Fri May 24 15:30:27 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist-close-under-parent): New function.

	(c-C-conditionals): New constant.

	(c-C-conditional-key, c-C++-conditional-key, c-Java-conditional-key):
	Use c-C-conditionals.

	(c-Java-conditional-key): Added support for "synchronized" keyword.

Fri May  3 22:03:13 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-Java-conditional-key): New variable.

	(java-mode): Set buffer-local variable c-conditional-key to
	c-Java-conditional-key.

Thu May  2 21:18:56 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-C++-access-key): Allow for whitespace between the
		  protection key and the colon.

Wed Apr 10 04:50:50 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-set-style): as a last resort, match exact case for
		  stylename.

Wed Apr  3 16:19:08 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-get-offset, c-read-offset, c-set-offset): Use
	 functionp instead of fboundp to test for OFFSET being a function.
	 This makes the documentation more accurate and allows for
	 lambda expressions to be used as offsets, instead of allowing
	 only symbols with function bindings.

Mon Apr  1 16:12:27 1996  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* Public Release 4.282

Tue Feb  6 22:35:36 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode-map, objc-mode-map, java-mode-map):
	In XEmacs, use set-keymap-parents if it is fboundp.

	* cc-mode.el (c-delete-backslash):
	Sync with old-c-mode.el.  Given by Ben Wing <wing@666.com>.

Mon Jan 22 23:25:21 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el: Added back autoload cookies.

	* cc-mode.el (c-emacs-features):
	Determine which paragraph filling regexp suite to use based on the
	Emacs version number.

	(c-fill-paragraph): Use the paragraph filling regexp suite as
	determined in c-emacs-features.

Fri Jan 19 18:57:01 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el:
	imenu is required in Emacs 19, but doesn't exist in XEmacs

	* cc-mode.el (c-site-default-style): New variable.

Thu Jan 18 23:51:17 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el:
	(java-mode, java-syntax-table, java-mode-map, java-mode-abbrev-table):
	New in support of Java.

Tue Jan 16 00:09:41 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-common-init): Make comment-multi-line a local variable.

Mon Jan 15 23:56:06 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-set-style):
	Conditional up-casing of stylename for backwards compatibility.

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist, c-set-style, c-add-style):
	All style names are case insensitive, but default to lowercase.

Sat Jan  6 01:08:45 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (cc-imenu-c++-generic-expression):
	New variable.  Integrated w/ FSF changes.

	(cc-imenu-c-generic-expression): New variable.  Integrated w/ FSF
	changes.

	(c++-mode): Set imenu-generic-expression.  Integrated w/ FSF changes.

	(c-mode): Set imenu-generic-expression.  Integrated w/ FSF changes.

	(c-common-init): Make imenu-generic-expression buffer local.

	* cc-mode.el (c-progress-fini):
	Integrate RMS change: Fix "done" message.

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-lt-gt): New command.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	Only rebind M-q if fill-paragraph-function doesn't exist, as in
	pre-Emacs 19.30.  Integrated with FSF changes.

	(c-common-init): Set fill-paragraph-function if it exists.
	Integrated with FSF changes.

	(c-fill-paragraph): Return t if did special filling.  Otherwise
	return nil and don't change the buffer. Integrate with FSF changes
	for Emacs 19.30.

	* cc-mode.el: Switch to GNU style only the first time file is loaded.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5B.3: ansi-funcdecl-cont could include legal C++ `throw'
	declaration.

	(c-offsets-alist): ansi-funcdecl-cont => +

Fri Jan  5 23:14:12 1996  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	Restore old CASE 3 logic -- checking for at a c-conditional-key.

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5A.2: watch out for enum function
	return types. CASE 15D: check for landing on a brace that opens a
	nested function.

Wed Nov 22 14:55:12 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	*  (c-beginning-of-statement-1): CASE 3, can't just return t at
	   end of let clause since this will break arglist-cont-nonempty
	   lines (see buggy line below).  Doing a backward-up-list could
	   be slow, but I don't see any other way of doing this.

	   void
	   C_entries (c_ext, inf)
		int c_ext;			/* extension of C */
		FILE *inf;			/* input file */
	   {
	     /* Consider token only if some complicated conditions... */
	     if ((definedef != dnone
		  || (cblev == 0 && structdef != scolonseen)
		  || (cblev == 1 && structdef == sinbody)) /* buggy line */
		 && typdef != tignore
		 && definedef != dignorerest
		 && funcdef != finlist)
	       {
	       }
	   }

Fri Nov 17 22:01:36 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-offset, c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	Do not check for c-conditional-key when skipping backwards over
	statements that look sort of like conditionals.  This makes
	statements following nested functions indent correctly.  CASE 9B.3
	(unknown catchall) now gets triggered by the brace that opens a
	nested function.  These will get indented moderately correctly,
	but they are not assigned the correct syntax.  I'm not sure
	exactly what they *should* be assigned.  Also, this changes the
	relpos for top-level defun-open braces, but that will be very hard
	to fix, and it may break backward compatibility.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-offset):
	CASE 5H, inclass relpos should be relative to boi of the open
	brace, not the beginning of the class keyword.

Thu Nov 16 00:20:59 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5D.5, watch out for c-access-key set to nil, as in this case
	(in c-mode):

	typedef struct {
	    unsigned count:24,
		age:6,
		dirty:1,
		reserved:1,
		};

Wed Nov 15 23:38:05 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement, c-end-of-statement):
	Watch out for c-end-of-statement being called interactively.

Mon Aug 28 20:39:43 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-guess.el (cc-guess-region):
	wrap relpos calculation in a save-excursion.

	* Version 4.241 released.

Mon Aug 21 23:41:21 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-backslashify-current-line): Obsolete.

	(c-append-backslash, c-delete-backslash): Taken from XEmacs'
	old-c-mode.el

	(c-backslash-region): Use the version from XEmacs' old-c-mode.el
	since it does a better job of aligning the backslashes.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-defun): Watch out for point being on the
	first top-level open brace in the buffer.

Tue Aug  1 22:14:32 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-copy-tree, c-mapcar-defun): Define functions only
	available in XEmacs 19.12, or Emacs 19 + lucid.el.

Tue Jul 25 22:27:37 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-ObjC-method-call): New implementation
	better handles 1. indentation of arguments to keyword parameters,
	2. multiline method calls.

Fri Jul 21 22:08:04 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.texi (Customizing Indentation): Added a better
	explanation of the difference between setq and setq-default
	w.r.t. setting cc-mode indentation variables.

Thu Jul 20 20:19:33 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace): Fixed preservation of
	no-whitespace before brace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5A.1: Watch out for
	c-state-cache; it may or may not be in place, but it should be
	ignored.

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-colon): In call to c-lookup-lists, fixed
	incorrect quoting of symbols in the quoted list.

Mon Jul 10 15:44:55 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey): Watch out for
	embedded c-class-key keywords.

Mon Jul  3 18:05:33 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-common-init): Make a deep copy of c-offsets-alist
	so that changing the buffer-local value in one buffer doesn't
	affect the global value, or other buffers.

	* cc-mode.el (c-snug-do-while): forward-sexp call could fail;
	wrap it in a c-safe.

Fri Jun 30 21:42:23 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode, objc-mode): comment-multi-line must be nil
	if // is the default comment style.

	colon, watch out for when they already start on their own line.

Thu May 18 23:49:51 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (paragraph-start, paragraph-separate): backed out of the
	4.191 -> 4.192 change due to breakage in c-fill-paragraph
	and dabbrev-expand.

Wed May 17 22:51:46 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5C: more robust in searching for c-baseclass-key when not
	followed by a colon.

	* cc-mode.el (c-enable-//-in-c-mode, c-setup-dual-comments):
	new functions to allow users to optionally enable // as comment
	delimiters in c-mode.

	(c-C-comment-start, c-C++-comment-start): new variables.

	(c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode): use new variables.

Mon May  8 23:11:35 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-set-style):
	Ignore case in completion.  Use appropriate mode name in prompt
	string.

	* cc-mode.el (c-in-literal):
	Faster implementation for skipping over cpp macros, at the expense
	of prohibiting `#' characters as first non-whitespace char on a
	line inside another literal (i.e. string or block comment).

Wed May  3 22:52:32 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-read-offset): change to have an interface consistent w/
	switch-to-buffer

	Whitesmith.

Sat Apr 29 00:46:53 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	C-c C-v unbound since it conflicts with OOBR, which has a more
	useful binding.

Mon Apr 17 16:48:06 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-ObjC-method-call): Installed Lele Gaifax
	<lele@nautilus.eclipse.it> patch as suggested by
	mccallum@cs.rochester.edu for Objective-C method call indentation
	styles.

Wed Apr 12 21:02:46 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (paragraph-start, paragraph-separate):
	Installed the FSF's patch as explained below:

	Thu Mar  2 10:22:30 1995  Boris Goldowsky  <boris@spiff.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

		* ada.el (ada-mode): Remove "^" used as anchor from
		paragraph-start and paragraph-separate values, so that they will
		work with non-0 left-margin settings.
	[...]
		* cc-mode.el (c-common-init, c-fill-paragraph): Likewise.

	* cc-mode.el (c-hanging-semi&comma-criteria): new variable

	(c-semi&comma-inside-parenlist): new function

	(c-electric-semi&comma): use new variable
	c-hanging-semi&comma-criteria to determine if a newline should be
	added after a semicolon or comma, instead of hardcoding this logic in.

Mon Apr 10 22:00:28 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	When hanging a close brace, add just-one-space if there was
	already whitespace before point.

Fri Mar 31 01:15:07 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist, c-read-offset, c-set-offset,
	c-get-offset): added two new offset shortcuts, '* and '/ which
	stand for *0.5 and *-0.5 respectively.

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	added a new CASE 4 to catch labels just above the current line.

Thu Mar 30 19:00:02 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-protection-key, c-symbol-key): had to move these before
	c-baseclass-key which uses them.

Wed Mar 29 23:11:57 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-baseclass-key, c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode, c-guess-basic-syntax):
	This can be nil in all modes other than c++-mode.  Make this variable
	buffer local and it saves one looking-at call in the
	c-guess-basic-syntax tight loop.

Mon Mar 27 23:18:30 1995  Barry A. Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-recognize-knr-p): default value is nil for all modes.

Wed Mar 22 16:45:53 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el:
	CC-MODE style has to make a deeper copy of non-atomic lists

	* cc-mode.el: set "GNU" style just after creating the CC-MODE style

	* cc-mode.el:
	added c-recognize-knr-p and c-hanging-comment-ender-p variables to
	"CC-MODE".

	* cc-mode.el (c-C++-friend-key): new constant

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): use c-C++-friend-key to find friend
	declarations.  Note that template class friends don't start with the
	word "friend".

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-region):
	wrap a backward-sexp call in a c-safe to avoid bogus error
	conditions.

Mon Mar 20 23:58:32 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el:
	Only add the "CC-MODE" style and set the "GNU" style on the first load
	of cc-mode.el (not (featurep 'cc-mode)).

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): skip over case/default labels before skipping
	over other labels.

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist, c-set-style):
	"Default" style is renamed to "CC-MODE" style so as not to confuse
	matters (too much).

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-comments-syntactically-p): new variable

	(c-comment-indent): use c-indent-comments-syntactically-p instead of
	comment-column==nil to control M-; acting like TAB.  The latter
	behavior was too broken to work correctly.

Mon Mar 13 22:09:46 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode): setq comment-multi-line to t.

	* cc-mode.el (c-common-init):
	(c-set-style "GNU") moved out of this defun and into the top level
	of cc-mode.el.  This is pushed down towards the bottom of the
	file, to just after the calculation of the "Default" style.  Also,
	the style variables are not made buffer local until after this
	call.  Seems kludgy that its all order dependent, but it addresses
	the problem of setq-default at the .emacs top level not doing the
	expected thing.

Thu Mar  9 21:31:28 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5J: Watch out for
	c-beginning-of-statement-1 leaving us at bob with a following comment.

	* cc-mode.el (c-comment-indent):
	When comment-column is nil, indent according to c-offsets-alist,
	i.e. behavior is identical to hitting TAB.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-offset):
	CASE 5D.5: skip over any access specifiers found if inclass-p.
	CASE 5D.1: looking at a hanging member init colon only if not
	attached to an access specifier.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax, c-lineup-comment):
	TAB should always indent comment-only lines according to
	c-offsets-alist.  It should never pin comments appearing at
	comment-column.  Use M-; for that.

	* cc-mode.el (c-common-init): Default mode is now GNU

	* cc-mode.el (c-styles-alist): Mention the Default style.

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist-default): obsolete

	(c-offsets-alist): now contains default values.  These will always be
	captured in the "Default" style and all styles now inherit from
	"Default".

	(c-offsets-alist, c-basic-offset, c-comment-only-line-offset,
	c-block-comments-indent-p, c-cleanup-list c-hanging-braces-alist,
	c-hanging-colons-alist, c-hanging-comment-ender-p,
	c-backslash-column): All variables are now buffer-local.

	(c-set-style-1): new function

	(c-set-style): 1. removed &optional local argument -- use
	make-variable-buffer-local instead if buffer local style settings are
	desired; 2. Reset the style to "Default" before instituting the new
	style.  This means all styles derive from the "Default" style.

Sat Mar  4 00:41:01 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-comment-only-line-offset):
	Fixed the docstring to follow current semantics of the variable.

	(c-style-alist): Fixed GNU style for c-comment-only-line-offset to
	'(0 . 0) so that column zero comments will not anchor.

	* cc-mode.el:
	Moved the setup of the "Default" style to further down in the file.
	Also, this uses the new c-add-style API.

	* cc-mode.el (c-add-style):
	Added set-p flag for optional setting of the style.

	* cc-mode.el (c-conditional-key, c-class-key, c-comment-start-regexp):
	setq-default their values to the `C' values so that
	non-cc-mode-ized modes that rely on BOCM behavior still work
	(e.g. awk-mode).

Wed Mar  1 21:30:56 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-add-style): New command.

	* cc-mode.el (c-backward-to-start-of-if):
	better error message for orphaned else
	error.  It now prints the line number of the orphaned else.

	* cc-mode.el:
	added pending-delete and delete-selection properties for proper
	co-operation with pending-del and delsel modes.

Thu Feb 16 01:38:27 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-hack-state):
	it is legal for cdr to be nil when 'close brace is
	encountered.  Do we need the (consp car) test???

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 5H: Removed the test for preceding-char =
	to ?:.  This fixes two problems.  First, in objc-mode, there is no
	colon after access specifiers.  Also, some people might use macros for
	PRIVATE and PROTECTED, and these also don't have trailing colons.

Wed Feb 15 15:38:37 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	when ACTION is a function, the second argument is
	the buffer position the brace was inserted, regardless of any
	implementation details (i.e. may not be the same as where the brace
	actually resides during the callout).

	(c-hanging-braces-alist): update docstring to new callout semantics.

Tue Feb 14 19:54:50 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	when looking for an else-if clause,
	watch out for #else gotchas.

Mon Feb 13 23:14:51 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 5D.3: syntactic symbol should be
	'inher-cont instead of 'inher-cont-1.

Wed Feb  8 22:52:15 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	In punt section, nil out the syntax cache too,
	since its out-of-date.

Tue Feb  7 17:38:42 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	When hanging the brace, figure out when to punt
	and recalculate the entire state.

Mon Feb  6 17:07:45 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-whack-state): New function.

	(c-electric-brace): use c-whack-state to adjust state when inserting
	hanging closing braces.

Thu Feb  2 16:49:21 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-adjust-state): New function

	(c-electric-brace): make sure state is adjusted when preceding lines
	are re-indented via c-indent-line.

Mon Jan 30 16:49:10 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-safe-position):
	takes a buffer position and a state list since it
	must determine a safe position farther up the buffer than the give
	buffer position.

	(c-electric-brace): use new c-safe-position call sequence

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 14: when finding relpos, and calling
	c-b-o-s-1, lim must be higher in buffer than containing-sexp, so call
	c-safe-position to find this position.

Wed Jan 18 15:47:11 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	When c-auto-newline is nil, no newlines or
	re-indentation is performed.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 9D: after-cond-placeholder can be nil,
	tripping up (max ...).

Tue Jan 17 14:52:02 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 15D: safepos should be
	c-most-enclosing-brace of fullstate.  This could potentially be
	slower, but it is accurate.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 15F: Watch out for lim == point.  In that
	case, use (c-safe-position state) as the most enclosing known safe
	buffer position.

Mon Jan 16 23:55:43 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 9D: Kludged fix for
	c-beginning-of-statement-1 possibly leaving us at a buffer position
	before lim `after-cond-placeholder'.  c-b-o-s-1 should be fixed, but
	I'm worried about side-effects at this point.  It will be fixed in v5.

	* cc-mode.el (c-crosses-statement-barrier-p):
	Do not reset lim if, after skipping
	characters, point is inside a literal.  Point in a literal, is not
	considered safe.

Wed Jan  4 23:57:11 1995  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-snug-do-while):
	Watch out for non-hanging open brace on `do'.

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	In (memq 'before newlines) clause, when updating
	the c-state-cache, point can be <= the (car of c-state-cache) for us
	to strip out the most enclosing brace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-delete):
	Added delete-selection and pending-delete
	'supersede properties for proper "delete-erases-current-selection"
	behavior.

Wed Dec 28 16:05:02 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-exp):
	Don't try to call c-progress-fini if c-progress-init
	was never called (i.e. due to error having been signaled).

Wed Dec 21 00:28:24 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	If the temporary newline must be deleted (because
	it hangs), use delete-indentation instead of the delete-region
	hackery.

	* cc-mode.el (c-snug-do-while): New function.

	(c-hanging-braces-alist, c-cleanup-list, c-electric-semi&comma): To
	eliminate the newline between the brace that closes a `do' block and
	the following `while', make the c-hanging-braces-alist ACTION for
	'block-close be 'c-snug-do-while by default.  There is no more need
	for the 'snug-do-while cleanup.

Tue Dec 20 23:51:52 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	In updating the cache during the 'before section,
	watch out for c-state-cache being nil.

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace): Implement new semantics for
	c-hanging-braces-alist.  Also, fix state cache during re-indentation
	of preceding line when 'before newline is added.

Mon Dec 19 23:30:47 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-intersect-lists, c-lookup-lists): New functions.

	(c-electric-brace, c-electric-colon): Use the new functions to
	simplify the flow of logic in determining hanginess.

	* cc-mode.el (c-hack-state):
	When adding a close brace, watch out for balanced
	block sitting on list in car of cdr position.

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-semi&comma):
	Some minimal efficiency additions by
	including a backscan limit.

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-semi&comma, c-cleanup-list):
	Added a new clean-up:
	snug-do-while which will snuggle the `while' of a do-while up to after
	the closing brace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-objc-method-args,
	c-lineup-objc-method-call, c-offsets-alist-default,
	c-beginning-of-statement-1, c-guess-basic-syntax):
	Jumbo Lele Gaifax Objective-C patch.

Fri Dec 16 15:41:05 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 10: watch out for false else clauses
	(e.g. else_thing).

Wed Dec 14 23:11:59 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-postprocess-file-styles):
	Renamed from c-find-file-hook.  Hang this
	off of hack-local-variables-hooks, which won't be supported until
	future Emacs 19's.

Tue Dec 13 23:58:48 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): Watch out for lim!

	* cc-mode.el (c-hack-state, c-safe-position): New functions.

	(c-electric-brace, c-parse-state, c-inside-brace-list-p,
	c-guess-basic-syntax): Implemented two major performance enhancements
	used both in general, but also specifically during brace insertion.
	First, call c-beginning-of-statement-1 directly instead of wasting
	time in the user-command version.  Second, and most importantly,
	implement a c-parse-state cache so that the brace state for a
	particular line doesn't have to be completely recalculated 4 times for
	every brace insertion.

Mon Dec 12 20:20:49 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p):
	Fixed aggregate logic w.r.t. failures in
	forward-sexp.

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p):
	Order of magnitude improvement in performance
	by eliminating often costly calls to c-backward-syntactic-ws.

Fri Dec  9 23:39:31 1994  Barry Warsaw  <cc-mode-help@python.org>

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p):
	Special case speed up for when most enclosing
	brace of brace-state is nil.

Sat Sep 10 13:27:11 1994  Barry A. Warsaw  (warsaw@anthem.nlm.nih.gov)

	* Public Release of 4.85.

Wed Sep  7 18:41:29 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-fsf-menu, c-mode-map, c++-mode-map,
	  objc-mode-map):
	use a better feature test to figure out how to set the menu title
	string.

Tue Sep  6 13:49:46 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	in `class' keyword verification section, only skip forward for ?>
	template char if a matching ?< char was found previous to
	search-start.  This eliminates false match of template base
	classes.

Thu Sep  1 22:30:23 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report): updated var list

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-fsf-menu, c-mode-map, c++-mode-map,
	  objc-mode-map):
	do a better job of getting the menu title string appropriate for
	the mode being edited in.  Bogus, but necessary.  XEmacs is better
	in this respect.

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey): Lele patch for objc-mode

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	avoid "invalid search bound" error

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	skip special modifier chars in all cases, not just in "no balanced
	expr found" case.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 9: generalize and collect common code for finding position
	after conditional statements, and check for `while' statement of a
	`do' loop.  In that case, skip over the trailing semi.

Wed Aug 31 22:20:47 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-progress-init, c-progress-update, c-progress-fini):
	use a marker for end (and be sure to free it!) so that as
	indentation occurs, % can't go above 100.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	check on feature (fboundp 'add-menu) for FSF 19 (which doesn't
	have it).

	* cc-mode.el (c-progress-info, c-progress-init,
	  c-progress-update,
c-progress-fini):
	new vars/defuns for better long indentation progress
	reporting

	(c-indent-exp, c-indent-region): use new progress reporting

Tue Aug 30 21:57:37 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 6F, go forward 1 char from b-o-s of containing-sexp bufpos to
	find proper relpos of an arglist-cont.

	* cc-mode.el (c-offset-alist-default):
	statement-case-open default offset is zero

	(c-skip-case-statement-forward): new function

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 15: use c-skip-case-statement-forward in
	proper places to find the real relpos of statement's inside switch
	case/default bodies.  CASE 15D: remove special handling when looking
	at c-conditional-key.

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist, c-cleanup-list, c-mode-menu,
	  c-mode-map, c-symbol-key, c-indent-line, c-popup-menu):
	make sure ObjC is properly documented.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	be careful to check for c-access-key non-nil before calling
	(looking-at c-access-key).  For C, this is nil.

	swapped CASE 3 and 4, so that conditional statements are picked up
	properly

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	CASE 15D, calculate relpos from boi of beginning of statement
	prior to indent-point, unless we're looking at a conditional key

	change test of 'FSF in c-emacs-features to an fboundp
	set-keymap-parent test

Thu Aug 25 13:31:31 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-just-after-func-arglist-p,
	  c-guess-basic-syntax, c-lineup-objc-method-args-2):
	more objc patches from Lele

Wed Aug 24 21:06:05 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-command):
	with optional arg, shift-amt had wrong sign

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist):
	better handling of comments preceding arg lists

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	swapped CASE 6A and 6B so that empty arglists with close paren on
	separate line are properly recognized.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-menu, c-emacs-features, c-mode-map,
	  c-common-init):
	remove dependency on string "Lucid" in emacs-version.  Use
	features based means where such descrimination is necessary.

Tue Aug 23 18:43:28 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-fill-paragraph):
	merge with c-mode.el uses fill-region-as-paragraph

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist-default, c-offsets-alist,

	added syntactic symbol statement-case-open for
	statement-case-intro's that contain an open brace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-math): watch for equal signs in literals

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	CASE5 and CASE 6, better pick up of label's with potential
	embedded colons (scope operators).

Mon Aug 22 22:28:03 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-hanging-comment-ender-p): new variable

	(c-fill-paragraph): looks at c-hanging-comment-ender-p to see if
	*/ should be left on its own line.  c-mode.el behavior is default
	value t, but there have been *many* requests for nil's behavior.

Wed Aug 17 23:05:01 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-recognize-knr-p, c-common-init):
	fix the way this var is made buffer local

Tue Aug 16 20:05:49 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-recognize-knr-p, c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode):
	make it so c-recognize-knr-p is settable from c-mode-common-hook.

Thu Aug 11 20:40:06 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

Wed Aug 10 17:54:53 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist, c-read-offset, c-set-offset):
	can accept variable symbols as offsets.

	(c-get-offset): can now accept ++ and -- symbols, which evaluate
	to 2* positive and negative c-basic-offset.

Thu Aug  4 15:29:43 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	case 9C added small performance improvment to c-in-literal call

Wed Aug  3 17:37:30 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode-syntax-table, objc-mode-syntax-table):
	give CR same syntax as newline, for selective-display.

Fri Jul 22 18:42:38 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-star):
	fixed indentation problem when a star is not preceded by a slash.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-defun):

	conditions are properly handled at other levels of the code.

Thu Jul 21 22:34:19 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  <warsaw@anthem>

	* cc-mode.el (c-class-key, c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	greatly simplified, this constant now contains a regexp that only
	matches valid `class' keywords, in the C++ sense. It now ignores
	any template, extern, static, etc. keywords.

Tue Jul 19 09:53:37 1994  Barry A. Warsaw  (warsaw@anthem.nlm.nih.gov)

	* Public Release of 4.35.

Sun Jul 17 18:29:51 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax):
	Lele Gaifax's patch to fix an Objc problem...

	"this patch, applied to 4.32, will correct a little bug in ObjC
	mode.  Currently objc-mode fails to recognize a continued arglist,
	as it guesses every such construct is a continued method call."

Fri Jul 15 13:48:39 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey): don't get fooled by
	the following C construct:

	struct shmid_internal
	shmconv(
	    register int	s)
	{
	    int foo = 1;
	}

Tue Jul 12 14:36:10 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state): in body of `something bad happened'
	part, don't use beginning-of-defun to find "real" bod since based
	on some coding styles, this could loop us all the way back to
	bob. E.g.:

	int foo() {
	int a = 7;
	{
	    foobar();
	}}

	int foo() {
	int a = 7;
	{
	    foobar();
	}}


	Instead use scan-lists and be more robust about crossing
	unbalanced close braces.  Now even antisocial coding styles like
	the above can be quickly parsed correctly.

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state): small but important fix in
	`something bad happened' test. make sure that placeholder close
	brace ends up before indent point, otherwise we didn't cross it.

Thu Jul  7 13:56:08 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state): in `something bad' section,
	placeholder will always be just after any close brace so we need
	to 1- from it to check for ?}. Also, we probably don't need to
	check for placeholder-1 being nil.

Thu Jun 30 21:03:55 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-switch-label-key): a paren can follow the `case'
	keyword without any intervening whitespace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): when skipping over
	unary ops, remember that whitespace could be intermixed before the
	paren

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace): added brace-list-intro and
	brace-list-entry to list of hangables

	(c-hanging-braces-alist): added docstring for b-l-i and b-l-e
	hangability

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1): CASE 6: be sure to
	ignore switch labels too.

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist-intro-after-paren): new lineup
	function to conform to GNU style.

	(c-style-alist): for style GNU, arglist-intro set to
	c-lineup-arglist-intro-after-paren and arglist-close set to
	c-lineup-arglist to conform to BOCM GNU style.

Wed Jun 29 00:48:56 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): installed this patch:

	In ObjC mode 4.6 the tests 6D and 6E in c-guess-basic-syntax need
	to be swapped. Otherwise what is a continued method call line will
	be recognized as a 'arglist-cont-nonempty. Swapping these test
	will not interfere with the normal behaviour of cc-mode, since the
	test for the method call is surrounded with a test on (eq
	major-mode 'objc-mode).

	Emanuele (lele) Gaifax     | ...calling Emacs convenient, of course, is
	lele@nautilus.sublink.org  | like calling oxygen useful  -- Rens Troost

	* cc-mode.el (c-mark-function): new implementation based on
	c-parse-state.  I think this should work much better for people.

Tue Jun 28 23:57:42 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-just-after-func-arglist-p): partial fix for this bug:

	class foo
	{
	   foo()
	      :					// member-init-intro
	   a (0),				// topmost-intro-cont???
	   b (0)				// member-init-cont
	   {}
	};


	note that if there is a comment after foo(), its still broken.
	But that probably won't happen too often...

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist): don't limit skippages forward
	over syntactic ws to eol.

Mon Jun 27 18:25:42 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state): when looking to see if `something
	bad happened', and guaranteeing that the char-after placeholder is
	= to ?}, make sure that char-after placeholder is less than
	point-max (i.e. char-after placeholder returns non-nil).

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-star): should not re-indent line if
	introducing a comment not on a comment-only line

Thu Jun 23 17:54:49 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): when finding an enum, check
	to be sure its not a type descriptor on a return value of a func
	(i.e. skip-chars-forward for not semi or open paren).

Wed Jun 22 19:23:43 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state): when trying to find out if
	"something bad happened" be sure to check for crossing a close
	*brace* and not a close paren or square bracket.  Only crossing a
	close brace indicates badness.

Mon Jun 20 00:32:46 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-set-offset): initial contents of prompt is the
	last syntactic symbol on the syntactic analysis list -- the most
	likely symbol that the user wants to change.

Fri Jun 17 22:25:41 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist): fixed problem of skipping too
	many close parens when finding the relpos of arglist-close.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 6F fixed incorrect
	  relpos

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): CASE 8B and CASE 8C: when an
	otherwise brace-list-entry or brace-list-intro is found to start
	with an open brace, the line is given brace-list-open syntax
	instead

	(c-inside-bracelist-p): fix small bug in recognizing open brace at
	brace-list-intro line, and infinite loop problem.

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p): more accurate handling of
	nested aggregates. Now uses brace-state as provided by
	c-parse-state.

Tue Jun 14 22:25:09 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-forward-conditional): break infinite loop when
	finding commented out conditionals

Mon Jun 13 17:40:08 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report): Use new interface for
	reporter.el 2.x

Fri Jun 10 13:42:02 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report): remove defun-prompt-regexp
	from the list of vars if it is not boundp (i.e. v18)

Thu Jun  9 14:15:00 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-syntax): repaired all CASE numbers

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist-default): added syntactic symbols
	objc-method-intro objc-method-args-cont objc-method-call-cont.

	(c-offsets-alist): added descriptions for above new syntactic symbols

	(objc-mode-hook) (objc-mode-abbrev-table) (objc-mode-map)
	(objc-mode-syntax-table) (objc-mode): added for Objective-C support

	(c-objc-method-key): new regexp desribing an ObjC method intro.

	(c-fill-paragraph): objc-mode understands // comments

	(c-beginning-of-statement-1): added CASE 7 for objc-mode

	(c-in-objc-method-def-p): checks to see if inside an Objective-C
	method definition.

	(c-just-after-func-arglist-p): check for Objective-C method def

	(c-guess-basic-syntax): many modifications to look for Objective-C
	syntactic symbols: CASE 3.5, CASE 4G, CASE 4I, CASE 5E.

	(c-lineup-objc-method-call) (c-lineup-objc-method-args): new custom
	lineup functions for Objective-C methods.

	(c-submit-bug-report): look for ObjC mode

Mon Jun  6 19:47:19 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist): another fix to Ellemtel style.
	Since the style guide recommends braces around the body of all
	case statements, statement-case-intro should be 0, letting
	statement-block-intro of the following line pick up the proper
	indentation

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist): Ellemtel style should have
	c-hanging-braces-alist for substatement-open be before and after

Thu Jun  2 23:09:16 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-strict-syntactics-p): changed to c-strict-syntax-p

	(c-guess-basic-syntactics): changed to c-guess-basic-syntax

	(c-add-syntactics): changed to c-add-syntax

	(various): use new function and variable names

Wed Jun  1 15:46:19 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: bumping to version 4 in anticipation of objc-mode
	  support

Tue May 31 23:51:08 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-strict-semantics-p): changed to c-strict-syntactics-p

	(c-echo-semantic-information-p): changed to
	c-echo-syntactic-information-p

	(c-semantics): changed to c-syntactic-context

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): changed to c-guess-basic-syntactics

	(c-show-semantic-information): changed to c-show-syntactic-information

	(cc-mode.el): other internal changes to make terminology consistent

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 14.E, if defun opening brace is not at
	boi, its because its hung on right side so we need a different relpos

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE5, various.  Extend the notion of
	arglists to bracket lists, i.e. [...]

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	when skipping over commas after
	classkey's watch out for inheritance lists...

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	ignore labels and access keys

Tue May 24 22:04:15 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* Public Release 3.349

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	break out of infinite loop when
	finding `struct' keyword in arglist

Mon May 23 15:43:07 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	we need to recalculate semantics if, when
	re-indenting the preceding line, point changes.  If this happens, the
	relpos for semantics is invalid.

Thu May 19 22:27:55 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist):
	updated the various styles to set the correct values
	for substatement-open

	(c-style-alist): added dynamic setting of default style.  The way this
	works may or may not be a feature?

Wed May 18 22:07:15 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-backward-to-start-of-if):
	fix to correctly handle `else-if'
	clauses, which should be skipped when looking for the matching if.

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	don't get confused by a single struct
	type arg in a function's arglist

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	on backward-sexp failure, skip over
	funny chars and whitespace only when just before a paren

	(c-search-uplist-for-classkey): watch out for comma ending struct arg
	declarations which doesn't leave us in a class definition.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	fix the setting of mode-popup-menu for Lemacs 19.10.
	Menu must have a title string.

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist):
	changes to Ellemtel style: substatement sets its
	offset to 3, substatement-open sets its offset to 0.  Given by:
	<qhslali@aom.ericsson.se> Lars Lindberg.

Tue May 17 22:46:22 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	when backward-sexp fails and doing
	backward-up-list, and before skipping over noise characters, skip over
	any preceding syntactic whitespace:

	--------------V
		if ( ! backup_dev ||
		     sep1 != ':' || )

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	fixed small infinite loop in CASE5 test
	when barrier char is in literal.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 13: don't limit the search backwards
	for the beginning of statement

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	completely rewritten to properly account
	for cpp macros and statement barrier characters (e.g. { } ;) in
	literals.

Mon May 16 20:21:12 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p):
	must check that enum keyword truly introduces
	a bracelist and not that it is a type identifier for a declaration.

	I.e. match:

	enum foo { /* ... */ }

	but not:

	enum foo bar;

Thu May 12 22:52:12 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 4A.2 watch out for enum keywords in
	K&R argdecl lists.  These don't open enum definitions, but they are
	declarations instead.  E.g.:

	ret_stat (rpt_stat, filename, pcode)
	    enum xrpt_status_codes rpt_stat;
	    char filename[];
	    enum xpippop_codes pcode;
	{

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-C-conditional-key) (c-C++-conditional-key): new regexps which
	describe conditionals in the two supported languages.  This is
	necessary because `try' and `catch' blocks are defined as
	substatements equivalent to `while', `for', etc., in C++ only

	(c-mode) (c++-mode): set c-conditional-key, which is now buffer-local,
	to either c-C-conditional-key or c-C++-conditional-key.

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state):
	when we discover that an open brace we thought
	specified the bod, actually isn't the bod, we backup and search for
	another potential bod.  This is necessary so that open braces in
	column zero that aren't really defun opening braces don't trip us up.
	Our test for invalid bod is if we cross over an unbalanced close
	brace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 4G, in c-mode, fix recognition of the
	last line in the following construct:

	typedef int (*foobar)           /* if I break this into 2 lines ...*/
	    (int foo, char *bar);
	extern foobar really;       /* this is incorrectly indented */

Tue May 10 16:42:13 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-region):
	fixed a bug where comment-only lines were being
	skipped.  Wrapped an unwind-protect around mark copying so we can't
	leak marks.

	* cc-mode.el (c-emacs-feature): use variables emacs-major-version and
	emacs-minor-version if they exist

Fri May  6 21:09:58 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist):
	small changes to the Ellemtel style: inline-open and
	topmost-intro-cont are changed to 0 offset.

	* cc-mode.el (c-hanging-braces-alist):
	added (substatement after) so that braces
	will hanging on substatement blocks

Thu May  5 22:48:23 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-math):
	can now line up equals signs even if the equals isn't
	at boi.  E.g., it can now handle:

	float a = 1.0,
	      b = 7,
	      c = 9;

	* cc-mode.el (c-comment-start-regexp):
	new buffer-local variable which describes
	how comments start.  This improves generality for C-like modes with
	different comment intro styles.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-via-language-element):
	renamed to c-indent-line for better
	backwards compatibility, i.e. awk-mode

Tue Apr 26 16:17:29 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state):
	make sure we ignore any bogus beginning-of-defun
	bufpos's when we're searching back 2 bods

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	after finding what looks like a class
	header, search for both a semi (denoting a fwd decl), and an equals
	(denoting a struct init).

Thu Apr 21 21:12:26 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-electric-brace) (c-electric-semi&comma) (c-electric-colon)
	(c-indent-command) (c-indent-exp) (c-indent-region)
	(c-indent-via-language-element): eliminated extraneous optional
	arguments, i.e. lim and bod

	* cc-mode.el (c-adaptive-block-open): obsolete

	(c-offsets-alist-default) (c-electric-brace): added substatement-open
	syntactic symbol

	(c-hanging-braces-alist): added ability to hang substatement-open
	braces.

	(c-style-alist): changed defaults of block-open to substatement-open

	* cc-mode.el (c-safe):
	use Dan LaLiberte's version impl. workaround for an FSF
	19.22 bug

Tue Apr 19 15:15:41 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map): put c-macro-expand on C-c C-e

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-mode-map) (c-common-init): put in code to conform to Lucid 19.10's
	popup menu convention of using mode-popup-menu variable

Fri Apr 15 23:09:59 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-defun): handle buffer-read-only errors better

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-math): also lines up multi-line equal signs

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	replaced calculation of literal which must
	have gotten accidentally removed some time ago.

	* cc-mode.el (c-1bit-il):
	removed since it appears to be identical to c-in-literal,
	and thus obsolete.

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	programmatically ignore the `class'
	keyword inside template arg lists

	(c-enclosing-brace) (c-narrow-out-enclosing-class): new helper
	functions

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): fixed recognition of 'defun-open CASE 4A.4,
	CASE 13.A, 'block-close CASE 13.B, 'defun-block-intro CASE 14.E

Thu Apr 14 18:42:00 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-parse-state):
	record containing paren, but not balanced paren sexps

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	fixed a regression problem in recognizing
	the difference between an inline-close and a nested class-close

	* cc-mode.el: (c-parse-state) (c-guess-basic-semantics)
	(c-search-uplist-for-classkey): massive rewrite of all parsing
	components. c-parse-state now uncovers the brace nesting level of the
	construct from (bod 2) to point and the other two defuns use this
	information to make scooting around brace levels much quicker and more
	accurate.

Thu Apr  7 14:34:28 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	can now specify `hanginess' on close braces

Thu Mar 31 15:10:09 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* Public release: 3.304

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	class relpos should be at the 'boi of
	where c-class-key gives us a match.  This is because its too hard to
	make c-class-key match the typedef keyword on:

	typedef struct Foo
	{

	so its easier to make this fix instead.

Fri Mar 25 20:34:18 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-forward-syntactic-ws) (c-backward-syntactic-ws): minor speed ups
	achieved by calling forward-comment with a huge number so we don't
	have to return to the lisp loop after just 1 comment.

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	added another speedup where syntactic
	whitespace is skipped before doing a re-search-forward.  This requires
	however that the buffer be narrowed during the r-s-f because of the
	definition of c-class-key which matches \\` or empty-string-at-bod.
	It would be better to use \\`\\|\\= to match empty-string-at-point,
	but that's not defined for v18, and doesn't seem to work anyway, at
	least in Lemacs.

	(c-search-uplist-for-classkey): after finding a match for c-class-key,
	skip non-semicolons up to brace point.  If a semi is found, we're
	looking at a forward declaration, not a class definition.

Thu Mar 24 18:43:38 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics): do not limit calls to
	c-search-uplist-for-classkey to just c++-mode since even in C we can
	have nested structs and unions.

	(c-search-uplist-for-classkey): now returns a vector instead of a
	cons cell

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): modifications for new c-s-u-f-c return
	value

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-inside-bracelist-p) (c-guess-basic-semantics): when looking for an
	enum brace-list, c-beginning-of-statement could leave us at point-min,
	which could contain an intervening comment, so you need to call
	c-forward-syntactic-ws.

Wed Mar 23 23:22:37 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	another fix for infinite loops that
	can occur when indenting inside the second of multiple nested classes.
	This should also speed things up by further limiting the region being
	searched.

Tue Mar 22 23:12:58 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-mark-function):
	worked around call to backward-paragraph, which
	didn't work and wasn't the right semantics anyway.  Movement should be
	by beginning-/end-of-defun.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-exp):
	restructure the unwind-protect call to ensure that the
	`end' marker is always removed on any error condition.

	(c-indent-exp): find any open brace that occurs after point, ignoring
	lexical whitespace, including newlines.

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p):
	in the first goto-char, goto containing-sexp,
	not 1- c-s, otherwise, it will not properly recognize bracelists with
	comments on the end of the line.  The following
	c-beginning-of-statement will properly consume any preceding
	whitespace.

Mon Mar 21 22:01:25 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	must handle nil return value from
	scan-lists.

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	fix problem of infinite loops when
	there are balanced expressions between (bod 2) and the indent-point
	that aren't picked up by bod because they don't match
	defun-prompt-regexp.  We skip over this noise with scan-lists.

	* cc-mode-18.el:
	don't hack c-emacs18-common-hook onto c-mode-common-hook anymore. tell
	users to put it on their c-mode-common-hook themselves.

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey): end-of-defun can fail

Fri Mar 18 21:38:31 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	new performance tuned version.  Here
	are some numbers: hitting tab at the end of an 11k function, with an
	8k function just before it was giving me 2.637sec for
	c-indent-command, and 1.784sec for c-s-u-f-c alone.  Now I'm getting
	0.972sec for c-i-c and 0.180sec for c-s-u-f-c.  An order of magnitude
	improvement in c-s-u-f-c.  These are un-bc'd times. Other bottlenecks
	must exist in c-i-c...

	* cc-mode.el:
	added an eval-when-compile to pick up the reporter-* symbols when
	byte-compiling.

Thu Mar 17 20:56:04 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-colon):
	do scope-operator clean up immediately after
	self-insert-command so that subsequent indentation and hanging
	calculations will be performed correctly

Tue Mar 15 23:29:16 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	adjust for the fact that c-class-key
	now match 1 character before the `c' in "class".  goto-char 1+ foundp
	to get to the proper character starting the class definition.

	* cc-mode.el (c-read-offset): new helper function for c-set-offset

	(c-set-offset): sanity check OFFSET argument both interactively and
	non-interactively.  This seems to trip up many novices.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode-map):
	fixed binding for c-scope-operator. It is now on C-c :

Fri Mar 11 23:45:51 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode-18.el (c-emacs18-il): applied patch contributed by
	SAKAI Kiyotaka(ksakai@mtl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp) to fix infinite loop bug.

	* cc-mode.el (c-fill-paragraph): removed last 2 c-mode.el dependencies

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 8C: after moving to placeholder, which
	is bos, move over any conditional statments if looking at
	c-conditional-key.  Otherwise the following code indents incorrectly:

	main()
	{
	    while (cin >> float)
		cout << float
		     << float;   //  This should not be this far over but beneath <<
	}

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-exp):
	put an unwind-protect around the sanity checks so that
	point is restored on error

	* cc-mode.el (c-class-key): another fix to recognize keyword
	  `class' at beginning-of-buffer.

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): if class opening brace is not the last
	non-whitespace on a line, the narrow-to-region narrowing out of
	enclosing class will not have the proper begin point.  Make sure the
	region does not contain the class opening brace.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-region):
	fixed error signal when indenting region not
	containing balanced sexp. e.g. at the top level:

	int i,
	    j,
	    k;

	* cc-mode.el (c-class-key):
	another fix to recognize nested class but not the word
	'class' in a template declaration

Thu Mar 10 23:32:37 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	sped up about 8x by removing an
	unnecessary (I think) call to c-backward-syntactic-ws and a duplicate
	call to c-in-literal.  By using elp, I think these were the real time
	hogs in c-b-o-s-1 which was the biggest hog in
	c-guess-basic-semantics.

Wed Mar  9 22:15:26 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist):
	added a (beginning-of-line) call before the
	(backward-up-list 1) call in the special case for arglist-intro and
	arglist-cont-nonempty.  Without this, indentation would be different
	when point was at the beginning and end of line.  E.g.:

	main()
	{
	    if ((BuddyRec* buf = (BuddyRec*)(bufs[message_bufs++]
					     = ::new unsigned char[MessageBufSize]))
		== 0) {
	    }
	}


	On the "== 0) {" line.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-exp):
	try to be smarter about finding the beginning of the
	balanced expression to indent.  Gives results closer to old
	indent-c-exp behavior.

	* cc-mode.el (c-submit-bug-report):
	moved the require of reporter to after the
	y-or-n-p question. Shortened the package name so it will fit on the
	Subject line better.

Mon Mar  7 17:39:45 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-skip-conditional):
	new function. factorized duplicate code

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): fixed statement-cont relpos calculation in
	a continued statement following an else clause. CASE 8A and 8D changed
	to use c-skip-conditional.

Mon Feb 28 18:23:36 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-conditional-key):
	not sufficient to wrap conditional keywords in
	\\<...\\> since this will false hit a keyword followed by an
	underscore, which technically isn't a keyword.  An example is
	"do_table" which incorrectly gets marked as a `do' keyword.

Fri Feb 25 23:01:45 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	swapped CASE 7A and 7B so that we properly
	indentify a brace-list-close of an empty brace list.

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist):
	added the "Ellemtel" style which implements the
	coding style defined in "Programming in C++, Rules and
	Recommendations, Erik Nyquist and Mats Henricson, Ellemtel, ftp from
	euagate.eua.ericsson.se".

	* cc-mode.el: (c-point) (c-indent-defun): only check the value of
	defun-prompt-regexp if it is boundp (so v18 doesn't break)

Thu Feb 24 23:34:08 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-brace):
	fixed bug in temporary newline insertion when
	auto-newline is off.  If a temp newline was not inserted, don't try to
	delete it later on.

	* cc-mode.el (c-set-offset):
	changed the minibuffer prompt.  "Langelem" =>
	"Syntactic symbol", and put in a brief message so that people won't
	quote the symbol (as some novices have been doing).

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 4B.1, check for member init colon
	preceding point even after doing a forward-char -1.  Need to skip over
	constructor parameter list that span multiple lines, with the member
	init colon hanging on the last of those line.

	CASE 4D.1. added a backward-sexp call to handle member-init-cont's
	which are paren-lists broken across multiple lines.

	* cc-mode.el (c-inhibit-startup-warnings-p):
	new variable, used in c-emacs-features

	(c-emacs-features): rewrote feature extraction logic to be based on
	version numbers. This more closely reflects the current state of
	affairs of the main Emacs flavors.  There is sanity checking and
	warning messages built-in too, to help inform the user if there are
	known problems.

Mon Feb 21 18:13:53 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	swap case 4A.2 and 4A.3 so that brace-lists
	are checked before inline-open's, otherwise enums inside of classes
	are not recognized properly.

	* cc-mode.el (c-backslashify-current-line):
	use kill-region instead of kill-line so
	we don't have to use the kill-lines-magic hack.

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	do not register last-begin when looking
	at a case/default label, otherwise statement-cont lines after a case
	label will not be associated with the correct beginning-of-statement

Fri Feb 18 16:13:27 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist):
	must handle arglist-intro lines just like
	arglist-cont-nonempty lines in the calculation of containing-sexp in
	the let* statement.

	(c-lineup-arglist): do not hard-code offset to 2 if at the end, we are
	still looking at the eol.  I don't know why that was there...

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 4I, topmost-intro-cont's relpos must
	be the boi of the beginning-of-statement, otherwise multiple t-i-c
	lines get marching indentation.

Thu Feb 17 23:53:16 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-set-style):
	changed the sense of the optional argument.  Now, style
	changes modify the global variables by default, except when a non-nil
	second argument is given.  Only then are buffer-local versions of the
	variables made.

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist):
	fixed calculation of containing-sexp for the
	following code:

	main()
	{
	    if( someFunction(someArg,
			     anotherArg) &&
		someOtherFunction(someArg,
				  anotherArg))
		doThis();
	}

	* cc-mode.el (c-class-key):
	fixed class recognizing regexp so that it doesn't
	falsely match the word `class' in a template function declaration,
	e.g.:

	template<class T>
	int A<T>::foo(

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	moved c-indent-defun to C-c C-q.  This should be its
	final resting place

	(c-lineup-math): new optional custom indent function, not used by
	default.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	moved c-indent-defun from C-M-x to C-c C-i.  RMS says
	C-M-x is reserved.

Wed Feb 16 23:06:15 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode-syntax-table):
	change : back to default (. == punctuation)
	syntax class since c-label-key is busted when its (_ == symbol)

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-runin-statements):
	new lineup function for people who hang
	the first statement after the open brace.

	(c-offsets-alist-default): added comment about alternative indentation
	style for `statement'

Mon Feb 14 15:53:30 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-point):
	when defun-prompt-regexp is non-nil, b-o-d doesn't leave us
	at the brace, so we need to skip it as noise.

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-defun): if defun-prompt-regexp is non-nil,
	beginning-of-defun won't leave us at the open brace, so we must skip
	over defun-prompt-regexp... its noise.

Fri Feb 11 20:49:19 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 14.C, when looking for a ?: construct,
	and checking for not looking at a :: scope operator, make sure we do
	this comparison at indent-point, instead of the first non-blank line
	in the block

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 8C: if first stream-op is on a
	separate line (i.e. not on the `cout' line), it should be indented
	like a statement-cont, not a stream-op.  Relpos in this case is boi of
	the first preceding non-syntactic-ws line

	* cc-mode.el: (c-backward-to-start-of-if) (c-backward-to-start-of-do)
	(c-guess-basic-semantics): It is not enough to search test for
	looking-at "keyword\\b" since this will not catch "keyword_thing",
	which is a valid symbol and not a keyword.  There is no equivalent of
	\\b that matches at the end of a word-or-symbol string.  For now, I
	changed the looking-at's to "keyword\\b[^_]" which seems to work.
	There are probably instances of "keyword\\>" that are broken too, but
	we'll hit them as they occur, since I'm not sure they are broken.

Thu Feb 10 23:30:11 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-populate-syntax-table):
	only put c-mode/c++-mode common syntax
	entries into syntax table.

	(c++-mode-syntax-table): colon (:) gets symbol class

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-mode-hook) (c++-mode-hook) (c-mode-common-hook): added defvars for
	completeness.

Wed Feb  9 17:48:21 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* Public release: 3.229

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-braces):
	when calculating the initial semantics of the
	open brace, we only need to insert a temporary newline if there is
	non-whitespace preceding the brace, on the same line.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 4I, don't add `inclass' semantics to
	the list since the relpos already has any inclass offset added in.
	Otherwise we get inclass offsets added twice.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	fixed small problem introduced in version
	3.235. when skipping lexical whitespace, we must skip [ \t\n].
	newline wasn't getting skipped.

Tue Feb  8 22:05:48 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-offsets-alist) (c-offsets-alist-default): added `friend' syntactic
	symbol for recognition of C++ friend declarations.  Default offset is
	0.

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): recognize C++ friend declarations, and add
	`friend' syntactic symbols as a modifier.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	when narrowing out enclosing class, and
	calculating start of region to narrow to, do not skip all syntactic
	ws, just lexical whitespace (change c-forward-syntactic-ws call to
	skip-chars-forward). Otherwise, you could skip into the middle of a C
	comment block and not figure out that what you're looking at is a `c'
	syntactic symbol.

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-offsets-alist) (c-offsets-alist-default) (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	added defun-block-intro syntactic symbol which controls indentation
	for the first line in a top-level defun, analogous to
	statement-block-intro.  (CASE 14.E)

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-defun):
	catch any errors that occur in c-indent-exp and make
	sure point is restored and the temporary mark is destroyed.

	* cc-mode.el: (c-untame-characters) (c-backscan-limit) (c-tame-insert)
	(c-tame-comments) (c-emacs18-fsws) (c-emacs18-bsws) (c-emacs18-il):
	moved these defuns and vars to cc-mode-18.el file.

	(c-mode-map): do not install Emacs 18-only bindings

	(c-populate-syntax-table): do not install Emacs 18-only syntax table
	entries

	(c-insert-and-tame): renamed to c-insert-special-chars and make this
	call only self-insert-command.  Don't worry about Emacs 18
	compatibility.

	(c-mark-function) (c-common-init): Don't worry about Emacs 18
	compatibility.

	(c-emacs19-accurate-fsws): renamed to c-forward-syntactic-ws. Don't
	worry about Emacs 18 compatibility.

	(c-emacs19-accurate-bsws): renamed to c-backward-syntactic-ws. Don't
	worry about Emacs 18 compatibility.

	(c-8bit-il): renamed to c-in-literal. Don't worry about Emacs 18
	compatibility.

	(c-submit-bug-report): remove reporting of c-backscan-limit and
	c-untame-characters since these are for Emacs 18 only.

Wed Feb  2 00:00:40 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist):
	add kludge for arglist-cont-nonempty to get
	correct indentation.

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): CASE 5D: arglist-cont-nonempty's relpos
	needs to be boi of containing-sexp paren.  this is good for + offset,
	but bad for c-lineup-arglist, so add the kludge described above.

Tue Feb  1 22:14:35 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-inside-bracelist-p):
	enum keyword could be preceded by a typedef
	keyword

	* cc-mode.el (c-comment-region):
	removed as obsolete, use comment-region instead.
	Put the new comment-region function in, but commented out.

	* cc-mode.el (c-default-macroize-column):
	changed to c-backslash-column. Default
	value changed to 48 from 78.  This is merged from c-mode.el

	(c-macroize-region): changed to c-backslash-region for c-mode.el merge.

Mon Jan 31 22:57:05 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 8B.3: instead of try-block-open, which
	is now gone, put statement-cont, block-open on semantics list.
	Eventually I may call a recognition hook, and/or exceptions probably
	fall through to here.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 5E. go to beginning of statement
	before looking getting relpos, so that we properly pick up nested
	argument lists.

	* cc-mode.el (c-common-init):
	better setting up of Lucid menubar (use mode-name as
	menu bar title)

	(c-popup-menu): use mode-name in menu title

	* cc-mode.el (c-keep-region-active):
	shouldn't check for interactive-p in tests

	(c-submit-bug-report): don't keep region active.

	* cc-mode.el (c-keep-region-active): no-op for FSF 19

	(c-set-style) (c-beginning-of-statement) (c-end-of-statement)
	(c-up-conditional) (c-backward-conditional) (c-forward-conditional)
	(c-popup-menu): added a call to c-keep-region-active

	(c-tame-comments) (c-indent-command) (c-indent-exp) (c-indent-defun)

	to c-keep-region-active

Sun Jan 30 20:22:09 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-map):
	remapped c-toggle-hungry-state to C-c C-d so it would
	not interfer with standard C-c C-h key prefix help mapping

Fri Jan 28 22:16:29 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-switch-label-key):
	fixed what can occur between the `case' keyword
	and the colon.  Its any amount of whitespace, followed by a single,
	non-whitespace character, followed by any number of other characters.

Thu Jan 27 21:15:57 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-fill-paragraph):
	much better for C++ style comments. 1. does not
	munge up font-lock regions by inserting/deleting the intended
	fill-prefix. 2. does not assume that leading whitespace before // is
	spaces, *but* fill-prefix must be consistent for every line in the
	region.

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-menu): moved this higher up in file

	* cc-mode.el (c-end-of-statement): simple paren mismatch in call to
	c-beginning-of-statement

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 2, skip over any preceding blank lines
	that can occur before the comment. This fixes comment indentation for
	the second and following paragraphs in a multi-paragraph C block
	comment region with no leading stars.

	(c-lineup-C-comment): don't assume relpos is at the beginning of the
	line (even though it usually is).

	simplify description of what can follow a 'case' tag

	* cc-mode.el: Use copy-alist instead of c-copy-sequence

	so existing menubars aren't clobbered

	* cc-mode.el (c-copy-sequence):
	workaround for FSF 19.22 bug in copy-sequence

Wed Jan 26 22:38:20 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-comment): renamed from c-indent-for-comment

	(c-lineup-comment): call c-comment-indent when a comment-only line's
	indentation is at or to the right of comment-column.

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): when a comment-only line's indentation is
	at or to the right of comment-column, only 'comment-intro is on the
	semantics list since the comment does not indent relative to a
	non-comment line would get indented.

	* cc-mode.el (c-lineup-arglist):
	now correctly handles arglist-close langelems
	(i.e. closing parens in an arglist)

	* cc-mode.el (c-offsets-alist-default):
	new constant containing unchanging default
	settings for langelems

	(c-offsets-alist): value is set as a distinct copy of
	c-offsets-alist-default.

	(c-set-style): if 'c-offsets-alist is found in style, first reset the
	value of this variable to c-offses-alist-default, then change only
	those langelems that differ.

	* cc-mode.el (c-style-alist):
	changed defconst to defvar. removed comments from
	c-mode merge

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-region): minor format change

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-region):
	merged in RMS's latest c-indent-region. Added a
	skip of blank lines before the current line is indented. Recalculate
	beginning-of-defun lim inside of top-level while loop so that
	back-parsing is further restricted properly, speeding indentation
	calculation.

Tue Jan 25 18:01:01 1994  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-fill-paragraph): small fix to RMS's paren level typo

	* cc-mode.el (c-auto-hungry-string): minor-mode-alist variable

	(c-common-init): auto-hungry designation string happens on
	minor-mode-alist now

	(c-update-modeline): sets the c-auto-hungry-string

	* cc-mode.el (c-electric-semi&comma):
	only re-indent line when c-auto-newline is non-nil

	* cc-mode.el (c-mode-menu):
	new Lucid menu variable for popup and menubar

	(c-popup-menu): command for popping up a menu in Lemacs

	do the job already

	* cc-mode.el: (cc-mode.el) comment improvements

	(c-mode-map): a few merges from lemacs, but commented out for now.

	(c-insert-brackets) (c-insert-braces): taken from lemacs, but
	commented out for now

	(cc-mode.el): menus added from FSF emacs.  Still need menus for
	lemacs.

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 8B.3 now returns a try-block-open, but
	exceptions aren't yet fully supported.

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement):
	when in a comment, or looking at the
	beginning of a comment, only call forward-sentence if not called
	interactively.  Thus programmatically, this function always goes back
	to the real beginning-of-statement.

	* cc-mode.el (cc-mode.el): changes to comments at top of file

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c-common-init) (c-style-name) (c-set-style): removed c-style-name,
	and no longer put style name on minor mode list

	* cc-mode.el (c-beginning-of-statement-1):
	do not let backward scanning stop inside
	a literal.  use c-in-literal to stop this, which really catches only
	preprocs

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 13, block-close relpos should be boi
	of relpos to catch "} else {" constructs

	    if(&blatz,
	    if(*bar,

	* cc-mode.el (c-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 8A.  do and else clauses aren't

	make sure we're left at or after lim

	* cc-mode.el: (c-electric-brace) (c-electric-slash) (c-electric-star)

	removed my old c-beginning-of-statement -- we'll go with FSF's and fix
	it as need bee

Mon Dec 27 23:25:17 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	argument, lim

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): corrected to use new arg list for the above

	new function, but block-open doesn't use it
	by default yet

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): moved M2 (block-open) test into body of
	defun instead of at the end -- to many special case tests

Mon Dec 20 17:55:38 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c-indent-command):
	guarantee that c-tab-always-indent == nil has the
	same semantics as in BOCM

	* cc-mode.el (cc-mode.el): pulled in bocm's beginning-of-statement,
	end-of-statement and related defuns, but I still need to make a pass
	through them.

	(c-up-conditional) (c-backward-conditional) (c-forward-conditional):
	yanked in verbatim from c-mode.el

	(c-backslash-region): fset from c-macroize-region.  also, we're

	new optional add-p arg. when non-nil, require-match on
	completion is inhibited and new langelem symbols can be added to the
	c-offsets-alist.

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): CASE 7C has been extended to properly
	recognize conditional's substatements.  CASE 7D now handles continued
	statements.  CASE 7A now recognizes only func local class opening
	braces, which means 7C + M2 will catch substatement block-opens.

	(c-offsets-alist): added substatement langelem

	* cc-mode.el (c-strict-semantics-p):
	default value to nil for debugging purposes

	(c-guess-basic-semantics): block-open langelem is now a relpos-less

	testing end-point of parse-partial-sexp, not the classkey search begin
	point.

Wed Dec  1 23:35:44 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-macroize-region):
	simplified so begin/end semantics are identical
	to cc-comment-region.

	(cc-backslashify-current-line): do not (forward-char -1) if eol ==
	bol.  Also, must let-bind kill-lines-magic to nil so that blank line,
	with only a \ on it will not consume the newline character

Mon Nov 29 22:50:30 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-indent-region):
	only generate an error on non-open paren/brace
	when shutup-p is nil

	* cc-mode.el:
	(cc-uncomment-region) (cc-comment-region): combined into 1 function,
	bound to C-c C-c and behavior analogous to cc-macroize-region.

	(cc-up-block) (cc-down-block): new commands, bound to C-c C-u and C-c
	C-d respectively.

	* cc-mode.el (cc-indent-exp):
	don't indent line with cc-indent-via-language-element
	if line is blank

	* cc-mode.el (cc-electric-brace):
	use (boundp 'blink-paren-function) as emacs
	version test, not cc-emacs-features.  The latter breaks on Emacs18's
	with the syntax patch

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	fixed the comment-intro regexp to ignore
	newlines. (spaces and tabs only)

Fri Nov 26 19:01:34 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	fixed two small bugs. first, the cdr
	of foundp should be cc-point boi to catch any template prefix on the
	class key (remember we're searching backwards now -- maybe we should
	search forward, eh?).  Also, we have to set donep to (not foundp) so
	that the search ends when we haven't found any classkey

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 13.D make sure we're not looking at a
	globally scoped function call

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	arglist-close should relpos boi of
	containing-sexp

	(cc-change-semantic-symbol-offset): fixed setqcdr typo

	(cc-offsets-alist): arglist-close default is now +

	* cc-mode.el (cc-beginning-of-statement):
	fix problem when crossing a paren level
	(i.e. the cc-safe forward-sexp call fails).  just move back a space
	and keep going.

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): expand CASE 5C test and CASE 5E relpos
	calculation

Wed Nov 24 22:54:31 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-safe):
	added this macro back in -- it seems to be useful

	(cc-beginning-of-statement): really improved this a lot. we only go
	back a sexp if we aren't already at the beginning of indentation.
	This is now a more generally useful function since it seems to do the
	right thing under all circumstances.

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): lots of changes to use the new cc-b-o-s
	function.  All known indentations after hanging braces are now fixed.
	This includes case 4D.5, CASE 7, CASE 12, and CASE 13.F.  Are there
	others?

	* cc-mode.el (cc-offsets-alist): added knr-argdecl offset

	(cc-change-semantic-symbol-offset): allow addition of new langelem
	symbols with universal arg

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): added recognition of subsequent
	knr-argdecl langelems in cc-c-mode only

	* cc-mode.el (cc-electric-brace):
	in brace-else-brace cleanup, I forgot to insert
	the new "} else {" string after deleting the old string!

	* cc-mode.el:
	(cc-back-block) (cc-safe-uplist) (cc-safe-downlist): obsolete

	(cc-search-uplist-for-classkey): completely rewritten for speed. it
	now uses re-search-backwards limited to two bod's back.  Orders of
	magnitude faster when operating towards the end of a large file.  In
	fact exec time is not buffer size dependent anymore (but like
	everything else, it is bod dependent of course).

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): fixed cases 4, 7, and 12 to work with the
	new cc-search-uplist-for-classkey

Tue Nov 23 22:41:41 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	fixed case 4F. if a class-close is found,
	it should indent relative to the class declaration, not the opening
	brace (i.e. the cdr of inclass-p, not the car)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	fix CASE 12's determination of the type of
	langelem that a brace closes.

	* cc-mode.el (cc-c++-mode-syntax-table):
	switched A/B comment styles as per Paul
	Smith's FSFmacs patch

	(cc-1bit-il): switched A/B comment styles as per Paul Smith's FSFmacs
	patch

	* cc-mode.el (cc-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	only search when in a C++ buffer.  C
	buffers have no enclosing class!

	* cc-mode.el (cc-electric-pound):
	oops, forgot to prefix-numeric-value arg on the
	self-insert-command

	* cc-mode.el (cc-mark-function):
	must funcall the second call to push-mark since
	v18 only accepts 2 arguments, not the 3 of v19.

	(cc-electric-brace): fix the blink-paren-function/-hook mismatch for
	v18 vs. v19.

	(cc-point): added the (,@ nil) form as a workaround for v18's
	backquote bug.  Doesn't seem to hurt us for v19 so I left it in for
	everyone.

Mon Nov 22 23:29:19 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	CASE 12, always return boi of the line
	that containing-sexp is on, not just for block-close langelem

	* cc-mode.el (cc-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	make backward searching slightly more
	efficient by stopping when char under search-start is a close brace

	* cc-mode.el (cc-label-key):
	new constant, change all concat'd label regexps to use
	this new constant

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): fix case 13.D to not accidentally code a
	statement that follows a label as a ?: construct

	* cc-mode.el (cc-indent-command):
	fixed behavior when cc-tab-always-indent was nil.
	should now be like old behavior (CASE 1)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-emacs-features): improve documentation

	* cc-mode.el (cc-point):
	retain quoted symbol semantics on argument but don't use
	dangerous `eval' to get an eq ready symbol

	* cc-mode.el (cc-indent-exp):
	better error messages so people don't get as confused

	* cc-mode.el (cc-beginning-of-statement):
	much more robust movement across balanced
	expressions now correctly finds the beginning of statements for very
	complex forloops and more.  We now no longer assume that expressions
	begin and end on a single line.

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): CASE 5C is expanded to correctly locate
	multi-line mathematical paren groupings.  Also, CASE 5E now returns
	boi at the beginning-of-statement for any arglist-cont.

	* cc-mode.el:
	(cc-electric-brace) (cc-electric-slash) (cc-electric-star)
	(cc-electric-semi&comma) (cc-electric-colon)
	(cc-change-semantic-symbol-offset): changed docstrings to more
	accurately describe defuns' behavior

	* cc-mode.el (cc-indent-exp):
	calculate bod before doing the forward-sexp since
	unindented open parens in col0 lower down will mess this calculation
	up.

Sat Nov 20 21:53:29 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-submit-bug-report): typo on cc-hanging-colons-alist

	* cc-mode.el:
	(cc-keep-region-active) (cc-make-region-active): split this into a
	macro (the former) and a defun (the latter).  This way we can check
	for interactivity as expected, but still cut down on the number of bc
	warnings.

	* cc-mode.el:
	(cc-setup-comment-indent-variable) (cc-keep-region-active): make these
	defuns so that the .elc file won't be editor version specific. The
	trade off is that the byte compiler will complain

	* cc-mode.el (cc-lineup-C-comments):
	limit re-search-forward to eol, not eol-1...
	why did we do this?

	* cc-mode.el:
	(cc-electric-brace) (cc-electric-semi&comma) (cc-electric-colon):
	re-indent the line even if cc-auto-newline is nil, just don't add any
	newlines

	* cc-mode.el (cc-offsets-alist):
	multi-line strings should be shoved against the
	left side margin

	* cc-mode.el (cc-setup-comment-indent-variable):
	new macro to cut down on byte
	compiler warnings

	* cc-mode.el (cc-case-statement-key):
	should now recognize character constants as
	arguments to case statement

	* cc-mode.el (cc-keep-region-active):
	support for FSFmacs and don't lay down calls
	to variables that don't exist

	(cc-submit-bug-report): variable typos

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed order of macro expansions.  defmacro's must appear before their
	first use -- this is probably why cc-point was busted in compiled code

Fri Nov 19 18:44:54 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	added some minimal recognition of template
	continuation lines.  Probably not so great.

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): fixed top-level decl continutation lines

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): fixed ?: constructs

	* cc-mode.el:
	(cc-c++-mode) (cc-c-mode): setq'ing of comment-start/-end must happen
	*after* cc-common-init for those values to retain their proper settings

	(cc-indent-exp): add optional SHUTUP-P argument to suppress
	operational messages.

	(c++-indent-exp): removed this commented out function. I think the
	byte-compiled, simplified cc-indent-exp is fast enough!

	(cc-indent-region): stolen from c-mode and fixed.

	(cc-beginning-of-inheritance): backscanning must stop when we're
	looking at a cc-class-key

	(cc-guess-basic-semantics): inher-intro and inher-cont should not have
	inclass langelem added since their relpos offsets already contain any
	inclass offset

Thu Nov 18 23:06:37 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-change-semantic-symbol-offset): new command

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics):
	added recognition of 'block-open braces
	following a full statement (yup they are legal)

	* cc-mode.el (cc-lineup-C-comments): added to support old
	cc-C-block-comments-indent-p behavior

	* cc-mode.el:
	removed the multi-line preprocessor stuff.  its just too much of a
	hack right now

	* cc-mode.el: some limited support for multi-line macros and such

Wed Nov 17 23:29:41 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed all byte-compiler warnings. did a pass through the comments and
	docstrings. macro-ized a few more defuns

	* cc-mode.el (cc-indent-exp):
	a slow, but moderately useful interrim solution.

	* cc-mode.el (cc-point):
	another small fix to the macro to get byte compilation to work

	* cc-mode.el (cc-point):
	small fix to macro expansion. must eval position so that
	'sym idiom still works

	* cc-mode.el:
	added cc-keep-region-active to all appropriate interactive defuns

	* cc-mode.el (cc-point):
	made this a macro so things should be much quicker when
	byte compiled

	* cc-mode.el (cc-electric-brace):
	insert any after-brace newlines after all
	cleanups have taken place

	* cc-mode.el (cc-electric-colon):
	semantic information can only be accurately
	retrieved on the line with colon for label, case-label, and
	access-key.  member-init-intro and inher-intro must be gathered from
	the following line.

	* cc-mode.el: (cc-electric-start) (cc-electric-slash): use
	cc-indent-via-language-element instead of cc-indent-line

Tue Nov 16 23:04:59 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-electric-colon): deleted

	* cc-mode.el (cc-electric-brace):
	inhibit blinking any close paren until we've done
	all our magic, then just call blink-paren-function manually

	* cc-mode.el (cc-guess-basic-semantics): CASE 4 was missing a call to
	cc-backward-syntactic-ws which broke arglist indentations

	* cc-mode.el (cc-beginning-of-statement):
	catch multi-line function calls by going
	backward over balanced () sexps

	* cc-mode.el: had to add all the lineup functions from c++-syntax.el

	* cc-mode.el: continued if/while/do/else/for statements now work again

	* cc-mode.el: 1. a good shot at cc-electric-colon
	2. added cc-scope-operator bound onto C-c C-;

	* cc-mode.el:
	everything is rewritten and tested except c++-electric-colon and
	c++-indent-exp

Thu Nov 11 21:24:06 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: got rid of glaring byte-compiler reported problems.

	* cc-mode.el:
	The bulk of the rename work has been done.  The entire mode has been
	renamed CC-Mode.  The file has been renamed cc-mode.el, and all
	symbols have changed from c++-<thing> to cc-<thing>.  In addition, all
	known remaining c-mode dependencies have been eliminated.

	There is still much work to be done.

Tue Nov  9 22:26:06 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: rough attempt at syntactic analysis. more to come

Mon Nov  1 03:25:12 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-search-uplist-for-classkey):
	restore point if no enclosing class
	is found

Sun Oct 31 19:14:59 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c++-narrow-out-enclosing-class) (c++-search-uplist-for-classkey): new
	defuns

	(c++-point): added 'boe and 'eoe positions

Fri Oct 29 22:42:35 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	totally screwed up indentation.  we're going to have to back out the
	last few mods.  URG!

	* cc-mode.el (c++-indent-exp):
	special case of looking at ?{, should not add
	c-indent-level since this is only for C statements wrt containing
	block and not block opening paren

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	undid split from previous revision. now case
	3A always returns 0.  Any additional top-level brace offset gets
	applied in c++-indent-line and c++-indent-exp (although the later does
	not yet work).

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	needed to split case 3A into 2 parts since
	bobp does not get the same indent as a top-level opening paren

Wed Oct 27 14:28:16 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-common-init):
	don't set the auto-hungry state here since the
	mode hook has not been run yet.

	(c++-mode) (c++-c-mode): set the auto-hungry state for the buffer
	after the mode hook has been run

Wed Oct 20 18:46:53 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode-map):
	do NOT define C-m and C-j, so as to retain the
	standard default settings for these keybindings

Mon Oct 11 16:32:02 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	in CASE 3C, when checking for hanging member
	init colon, but not scope operator, we didin't check for double colons
	when looking at the preceding-char.  Now look at char before point and
	char 2 before point.  If both are colons, we're looking at a scope
	operator.

Fri Oct  1 13:21:00 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-common-init):
	changed the test for comment-indent-function to
	checking for boundp of the variable instead of c++-emacs-features
	since Emacs 18 with syntax patches is (8bit v19) but does not have the
	variable bound.

Wed Sep 29 21:08:29 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-backward-to-start-of-if):
	better error message for else with no if

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	test case 3H, when taking the current-column,
	must subtract out the inclass-shift so it doesn't get added twice.
	inclass-shift is implicit in current-column.

Tue Sep 28 23:11:04 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode-syntax-table): don't be as harsh on FSF

	* cc-mode.el: (c++-cleanup-list) (c++-hanging-member-init-colon)
	(c++-auto-hungry-initial-state) (c++-auto-hungry-toggle) (c++-mode):
	use the terminology "valid" instead of "legal" to define acceptable
	values as per RMS's conventions.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-c-mode): improve the docstring re: running the hook

	* cc-mode.el (c++-indent-exp):
	use c++-cont-indent to calculate continued statement
	indentation amount.  remove large part of hackery here so lets watch
	and see if anything got broken, but I think c++-c-i should do the
	trick for all constructs

	* cc-mode.el (c++-indent-defun):
	better, quicker implementation of this defun

	* cc-mode.el (c++-electric-pound):
	better implementation of previous patch

	* cc-mode.el (c++-electric-pound):
	only align pound to left column if there isn't
	one already there.  This lets people enter ## as cpp concat command

	* cc-mode.el (c++-electric-semi):
	renamed c++-electric-semi&comma to implement },
	and }; cleanups

	(c++-cleanup-list): added list-close-comma to allow cleanups of },
	constructs.

	* cc-mode.el: cleaned up some comments

	* cc-mode.el (c++-common-init):
	new function to provide one entry point for all
	common initializations of the mode.

	(c++-mode) (c++-c-mode): use c++-common-init to do the common stuff,
	then do mode specific stuff.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	complete fix for proper indentation of base
	classes in a multiple inheritance declaration.

	(c++-baseclass-key): new constant defining regexp for base class defs

	* cc-mode.el: partial fix for multi-inher lines

Mon Sep 27 19:15:51 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-backward-to-start-of-if):
	give a more informative message if an
	unbalanced if/else was found

	* cc-mode.el (c++-compound-offset):
	fixed a bug when looking at "typedef enum",
	this wasn't registering as an enum start.

	(c++-indent-exp): fixed indentation of comma separated compound
	statements by using the function c++-compound-offset to calculate
	offset instead of just using the variable c-continued-statement-offset

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode):
	compatibility with old style comment-indent-hook and new
	style comment-indent-function

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c++-indent-line) (c++-calculate-indent): improved calculate in
	let-body for open-paren and top-open-paren values, using car-safe and
	cdr-safe

	(c++-indent-line): fix typo bug when looking at open brace.

	(c++-indent-line): apply TOPLEVEL c-brace-offset when brace is at top
	level wrt class, or real top level.

	* cc-mode.el (c-brace-offset): moved here from c-mode.el

	(c++-mode): for vars c-brace-offset and c++-block-close-brace-offset,
	both can now take list values.  describe these in the mode's
	docstring.

	(c++-indent-exp) (c++-indent-line) (c++-calculate-indent): when
	looking at an open brace, apply c-brace-offset depending on
	top-level-ness of the opening brace.

Fri Sep 24 22:05:21 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-indent-exp):
	when inside a class definition, if we are looking at
	an open brace, we apply c-continued-brace-offset instead of just zero.
	this allows users to indent the opening brace of an inline function
	body.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	when inside a class definition, if we are
	looking at an open brace, we apply c-continued-brace-offset instead of
	just zero.  this allows users to indent the opening brace of an inline
	function body.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	removed the commented out text which used to
	test for null state.  we never hit null state from c++-parse-state
	anymore.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-emacs19-accurate-bsws):
	new function which skips syntactic
	whitespace w/o treating cpp macros as comments syntactically.

	(c++-emacs18-bsws): renamed from c++-backwards-syntactic-ws

	(c++-lemacs-pre19-8-bsws): renamed from c++-backwards-syntactic-ws-1

	(c++-emacs18-il): renamed from c++-in-literal

	(c++-8bit-il): renamed from c++-in-literal-8-bit

	(c++-1bit-il): renamed from c++-in-literal-1-bit

	Changed the way compatibility is fset into the function symbols
	c++-backward-syntactic-ws and c++-in-literal.

Tue Aug 10 16:44:26 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: minor cosmetic comment typo

Thu Jul 29 00:18:00 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: consensus was to nuke c++-insert-header

Mon Jul 12 20:37:27 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode.el): updated the comments at the top of the file

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	removed test for null state during initial
	parse from beginning-of-defun to indent-point.  this is obsolete now.

Fri Jul  2 22:42:03 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-mode-map): removed bindings to obsolete functions
	c++-beginning-of-defun and c++-end-of-defun.

	(c++-electric-terminator) (c++-in-literal) (c++-in-literal-8-bit)
	(c++-in-literal-1-bit) (c++-point) (c++-indent-defun): changed all
	references of obsolete functions c++-beginning-of-defun and
	c++-end-of-defun to beginning-of-defun and end-of-defun respectively.

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c++-match-header-strongly) (c++-defun-header-strong-struct-equivs)
	(c++-defun-header-strong) (c++-defun-header-weak)
	(c++-beginning-of-defun) (c++-end-of-defun): removed as obsolete.
	there are better and cheaper ways of accomplishing the same
	functionality.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-electric-brace):
	I missed a few calls to c++-indent-line.  Added
	bod argument to remaining few.

	* cc-mode.el (c++-calculate-indent):
	removed logic dealing with (null state) and
	placed an error call there in anticipation of removal of header strong
	matching stuff.  I want to be sure there's no way to get to this code

	(c++-electric-brace): added bod argument to calls to c++-indent-line
	so the correct bod is found, not the newly created one with the just
	inserted open brace.

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c++-indent-command) (c++-tab-always-indent) (c++-hanging-braces)
	(c++-mode): changed the not-nil-or-t language to read "other than nil
	or t"

Thu Jul  1 17:40:53 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el (c++-backward-to-start-of-if):
	changed c++-backward-sexp call to
	backward-sexp now that parse-sexp-ignore-comments is handled correctly.

Wed Jun 30 17:03:00 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	(c++-forward-sexp) (c++-backward-sexp): removed because these are obsoleted by the correct implementation for setting parse-sexp-ignore-comments. (c++-mode): improved idiom for setting up local vars

Mon Jun 28 15:47:13 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:

Wed Jun 23 13:58:52 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	hacking on syntax entry must be mode specific in -ws functions.  ie in
	c++-c-mode, hack c++-c-mode-syntax-table and for c++-mode hack only
	c++-mode-syntax-table.

Mon Jun 21 21:40:15 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	should not skip-chars-backward in ws-2, let forward-comment handle that

Fri Jun 18 21:31:24 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	another refinement to addition offset given to open brace lines in
	c++-indent-exp.  Check for not at top level wrt class before adding
	c-indent-level.

	* cc-mode.el: another fix to c++-indent-exp for member init lists

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-indent-exp when comments follow a continued statement

	* cc-mode.el: a fix to c++-indent-exp where c-brace-offset is < 0

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed some comment spelling errors which were fixed (but *not*
	reported!) by FSF

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed a problem where default_answer("boof: glorp"); was being
	incorrectly matched to a default: statement

Thu Jun 17 21:52:21 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	update language to accurately reflect state of Lemacsen and FSFmacsen

Wed Jun 16 22:27:29 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed indentation when base class declaration is on a separate line
	then the derived class intro header.

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. cleaned up the way closing block braces are adjusted in
	   c++-indent-line.

	2. also extended c++-block-close-brace-offset to allow list value so
	   the following style can be easily supported:

	foo(a)
	{
	    if(a)
			{
			asasdfsdf;
			}
	}

	  Previously, there was no way to adjust the closing brace into column
	  zero.

Tue Jun 15 22:04:43 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	use c-continued-statement-offset instead of c-indent-level to indent
	comma separated arg decl lists

	* cc-mode.el: bind C-m to newline-and-indent

	* cc-mode.el:
	much simplification on c++-fast-backward-syntactic-ws-2 to work with
	new forward-comment semantics

	* cc-mode.el:
	don't skip up past compound statement if we're in a member init list

	* cc-mode.el: fixed a bug in the translation of CASE 3 to cond stmt

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. cleaned up the spaghetti if's in CASE3 of c++-calculate-indent, by
	   converting all if's to a single cond statement -- I *hope* I got it
	   right!

	2. Added indentation, via c-indent-level of multi-line,
	   comma-separated, compound statements/declarations, with correction
	   for enum and static array inits.
	y

Mon Jun 14 21:54:38 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	merged in submitted patch to fix a possible bug which rears its ugly
	head in FSFmacs19.  I haven't verified it so the fix only happens in FSFmacs

Thu Jun  3 22:42:44 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: try to conform to GNU cosmetic style

Tue Jun  1 14:58:00 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	better to make a copy of the syntax table so we don't screw up text
	mode's syntax table!

Fri May 28 22:20:57 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed the bug in c++-electric-brace where entering an open brace while
	point is at bol and c++-auto-newline is nil did not indent the brace.

Tue May 25 18:37:21 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: some cosmetic differences to c++-emacs-features

Mon May 24 23:23:05 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: take out bogus defun c++-emacs-features

	* cc-mode.el:
	be really really smart about figuring out c++-emacs-features

	* cc-mode.el:
	we must use a different c++-in-literal for GNU19's 1-bit solution

Wed May 19 14:19:20 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: better c++-emacs-features deciphering

Tue May 18 15:13:39 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: no c++-mode-maintainer

Fri May 14 22:05:02 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	can't yet make c++-indent-exp work in weird situation (see bug reports)

	* cc-mode.el:
	make sure we check for default: in the same place we check for case:
	labels in CASE 4 of c++-calculate-indent

Tue May 11 21:41:13 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: a little better documentation

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed the compat cond when setting c++-backward-syntactic-ws

	* cc-mode.el: fixed the string-match call in c++-emacs-features

Mon May 10 18:20:42 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: check for forward-comment first

	* cc-mode.el: fixed syntax errors in previous mod

	* cc-mode.el: attempt to port between all known flavors of emacsen

Thu Apr 22 21:16:15 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	ask user if they want to submit a bug report before actually doing it

	* cc-mode.el:
	quick fix for when the ? part of a ?: construct is a negative number

Wed Apr 21 19:53:29 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: use new interface to reporter.el

Mon Apr 19 20:41:48 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: uuencode when sending to ftpmail

	* cc-mode.el: c++-mailer is obsolete now

	* cc-mode.el:
	modify c++-submit-bug-report to use reporter package, and require it.

	* cc-mode.el: updated some documentation about getting c++-mode

Fri Apr 16 15:36:39 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	in c++-indent-exp, during the logic which evaluates special
	adjustments in the line's indentation, the sequential ifs should be a
	cond statement since the conditions should be mutually exclusive

	* cc-mode.el: updated mail-server (getting the mode) comments

Fri Apr  2 15:35:10 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-backward-to-start-of-if wasn't taking into account "if" clauses in
	intervening comments.  Needed to add a c++-backward-syntactic-ws

Thu Apr  1 23:08:37 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	cleaned up (I hope) all docstrings related to auto-hungry features

	* cc-mode.el:
	modified c++-class-key to recognize typedef in addition to extern

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-electric-star handling of stars inside C block comments but
	not part of comment line head (i.e. stars embedded inside C block
	comment lines not at 'boi, don't re-indent line)

Thu Mar 18 18:49:42 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fix infinite loop in c++-fast... in the following situation
	\n
	#define x \
	-----------^
	hit return here

	* cc-mode.el:
	wrap temporary binding of # to comment syntax in c++-fast-... in an
	unwind-protect to ensure that it gets reset on any exit

Thu Mar 11 15:36:26 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed indentation of block comments after first /* line in c++-indent-exp

Wed Mar 10 18:50:29 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: c++-in-literal-quick wasn't checking for inside a string

Fri Mar  5 20:00:17 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: fixed regexps for case labels... I hope

Thu Mar  4 23:00:30 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: updated copyright date

	* cc-mode.el: c++-c-mode uses c-mode-abbrev-table

	* cc-mode.el:
	in c++-fast-backward-syntactic-ws, check for lim<point *after* lim has
	be let bound

Wed Mar  3 20:25:17 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: forgot to add basic inclass-shift

Tue Mar  2 20:11:48 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: handle underscores in c++-inher-key

	* cc-mode.el:
	inclass-shift is now calculated by multiplying inclass-depth with the
	sum of c-indent-level and c-brace-imaginary-offset.  Usually at least
	one of these c vars is zero.  Also, precompute inclass-unshift

	* cc-mode.el: 1. fixed bogus end-of-buffer error when lim>=(point)
	2. extended c++-class-key to include optional "extern" keyword

	* cc-mode.el: 1. extended c++-class-key to handle template definitions
	2. made MI-regexp in c++-calculate-indent into the global constant
	   c++-inher-key so it doesn't need to be concat'd every entry into
	   the loop.

	* cc-mode.el: fixed small infinite loop introduced in previous patch

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-indent-exp when a multi-line C block comment caused
	calculation of state to be wrong.  Now, when calculating line-end, we
	first check to see of eol is in a C comment, and if so, we scan
	forward until we find the end of the block comment.

	this algorithm might break if there is code on the same line, but
	after the closing */ of a comment. this is to bizarre to support

	* cc-mode.el:
	no longer rely on # being of syntax class comment for really patched
	emacses, except for convenience when in
	c++-fast-backward-syntactic-ws.  Also, in this method, go into a loop
	checking for cpp directives since its possible that a directive has a
	comment on the end of the line:

	#include <foo.h>      /* opening a block comment here
			       * which isn't closed until here
						   */

	Finally, fix c++-in-literal-quick to handle new syntax class of #

Mon Mar  1 23:32:40 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	no longer rely on # being of syntax class for really patched emacses

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-macroize-region will now take any prefix arg instead of just a
	negative arg.

Tue Feb 16 20:30:37 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: don't use _ as word constituent, instead fix regexps

	* cc-mode.el:
	give _ word constituent syntax class so indentation of case_ and like
	symbols will work properly.  forward-word will gobble underscores in
	symbols so that's the trade off for taking the easy way out.

Fri Feb 12 16:40:35 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-backward-to-start-of-if was necessitated because backward-sexp
	call was bombing out in new syntax, on single quote in preceding C++
	comment line.  use c++-backward-sexp to properly handle this and
	change all references of c-backward... to c++-backward.

Thu Feb 11 18:33:50 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	should only bind parse-sexp-ignore-comments to t if c++-is-really-fixed-p

Sat Feb  6 00:04:45 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	in c++-comment-indent, if previous line contains a comment only line
	that is to the left of comment-column, indent the line to
	comment-column

Fri Feb  5 23:41:34 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: fixed K&R C arg decl with keyword struct in line

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-indent-command to follow documentation. previous the
	following situation was broken: c++-tab-always-indent == nil and:

	...
	{
	foo;
	^------- point was here

	* cc-mode.el:
	use Ken Laprade's patch for format vs symbol-name print of
	c++-special-indent-hook

	* cc-mode.el:
	check for (not (c++-in-parens-p)) when deciding whether we're looking
	at a continuation line or not to avoid bad indentation of continued
	lines such as:

		if( !tnode->expanded_p() &&
			docobj->hasChild_p() &&
			docobj->tocLevel() < xmaxTocDepth )

	* cc-mode.el: fixed anchor of comment only lines in c++-indent-exp

	* cc-mode.el:
	anchor comment only lines to (current-column) if the comment is at, or
	to the right of, comment-column.

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-continued-member-init-offset works for line with just single colon
	line, where member inits follow on subsequent lines:

	ff::ff ()
	   :
	   xxx (0),
	   yyy (0)
	{

	* cc-mode.el:
	don't add c-continued-statement-offset if looking at a class's opening
	brace

	* cc-mode.el: fixed c++-indent-exp wrt stream ops

	* cc-mode.el: fixed another small problem with nested class indentation

	* cc-mode.el:
	another fix for nested class indentation when looking at the line
	after an access specifier.  we needed to substract one level of
	indentation

Tue Feb  2 21:27:52 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: modifications to better indent nested classes

Fri Jan 29 22:31:07 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	in c++-forward/backward-sexp, only let bind parse-sexp-ignore-comments
	to t if emacs is fixed (not really fixed)

Wed Jan 27 22:48:56 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	some previous fix (don't know when) broke MI continuation line
	indentation.  This fixes that problem by making sure we're not looking
	at MI-regexp

	* cc-mode.el: commented out bogus part

	* cc-mode.el: commented out bogus top level continuation indentations

Mon Jan 25 23:34:52 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed minor bug with c++-submit-bug-report which manifests
	only on unpatched emacses

	* cc-mode.el: fixed small bug in c++-submit-bug-report manifesting
	in unpatched emacses

Thu Jan 21 23:38:34 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-indent-exp must let-bind parse-sexp-ignore-comments to t for the
	whole duration

	* cc-mode.el:
	hack for c++-indent-sexp continued statement offsets... are there
	repercussions???

	* cc-mode.el: fixed c++-cont-indent free variable

	* cc-mode.el: partial fix of continuation lines at top level

Wed Jan 20 23:39:40 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: 1. remove infinite loop from c++-in-literal
	2. get rid of messages

	note that c++-in-literal-quick is broken wrt to old emacs patches

Wed Jan 13 22:57:51 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-end-of-defun needed to let-bind parse-sexp-ignore-comments to t

	* cc-mode.el: better c++-in-literal-quick

	* cc-mode.el: 1. cosmetic cleanups of code
	2. a pass through c++-mode docstring and all variables

	* cc-mode.el: another hack on the comments at the top of the file

	* cc-mode.el: a documentation pass

	* cc-mode.el: changed name of c++-backward-over-syntactic-ws to just
	c++-backward-syntactic-ws to more closely resemble new lemacs builtin
	function name.

	* cc-mode.el: fixed c++-syntax-mode-table to work with patched lemacs

Sat Jan  9 05:08:25 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: put # back as a comment-style

	* cc-mode.el: comment about new bc and backward-syntactic-ws

	* cc-mode.el: better syntax specifications for new patched lemacs

Thu Jan  7 22:22:53 1993  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	added c++-backward-sexp and c++-forward-sexp which are bound to M-C-f
	and M-C-b and work better than their non-c++-mode counterparts since
	they let-bind parse-sexp-ignore-comments to t.

Thu Dec 31 22:17:36 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	use the really, really, up-to-date syntax patch for Lemacs 19

Tue Dec 29 01:22:19 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: removed extraneous commented out code

	* cc-mode.el: need to ensure that c-mode is loaded in

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed a problem inside member init lists, where the first member (on
	the colon line) has its args continued

	* cc-mode.el:
	fix bug when indenting a line at level zero which begins at the
	beginning of buffer

Wed Dec 23 23:20:05 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fix for c++-indent-exp so that it properly indents c block comments

Fri Dec 18 16:15:12 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: greater improvements on c++-b-o-w-s performance

Thu Dec 17 23:29:18 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	another run at optimizing c++-backward-over-syntactic-ws based on
	information gleaned from calc.el experience

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-backward-over-syntactic uses beginning-of-defun instead of
	point-min as minimum distance to scan back

Wed Dec 16 21:52:41 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	check for brace insertion at not-quite-end-of-line (ie eol, ignoring
	any trailing ws)

	* cc-mode.el: allow c++-backscan-limit to be nil

Fri Dec 11 16:26:05 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	in electric terminator, don't just check for eolp to determine if
	terminator should electrify. also look for hanging whitespace which
	may look like eolp, even though it isn't:

		fooo();......\n
		      ^------^
	undiscovered ws---|

Thu Dec 10 22:59:25 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	simple fix in calculate indent so forward-char 1 at end of buffer
	won't throw an error

Wed Dec  9 17:55:17 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	error in default value for c++-untame-characters. needed to negate the
	check for c++-emacs-is-fixed-p

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed problems in electric-(star|slash) when inserting as first
	character in a buffer.

	* cc-mode.el:
	don't treat double-colon as member init when member defun is split
	across two lines at the scope operator. eg:

	HereIsAReallyLongClassName
	::HereIsAReallyLongClassName( const WithALongConstructorArgument& )
		: andItsFirstMemberInit( 7 )
	{}

	* cc-mode.el: added some thanks to the documentation

Tue Dec  8 23:57:27 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	better c++-submit-bug-report that works with all known mailers

Mon Dec  7 16:26:51 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed calculation of multiple member-inits where double colons can
	appear inside initing parens

	* cc-mode.el: improved documentation for c++-special-indent-hook

Sat Dec  5 02:52:04 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: handled member init lists with first embedded colon

	foo() : foo, foo,
	    foo, foo,
	    ^--- this should probably be indented to
	      ^--- here (under colon)

	but that's really hard and of minimal use.

	* cc-mode.el:
	finally figured out that "questionable member init" indentation
	section. It occurs when you have the following style:

	foo(...) :
		foo(9), blat(10),
		clob(3)

	Note the colon hanging on the previous line. Steve Vinoski is correct,
	we should not subtract a level of indentation from the shift since
	inclass-shift takes care of it.

	* cc-mode.el:
	seems like a fix for some close parens not getting outdented when
	c++-paren-as-block-close-p is t.  DOES ANYTHING ELSE BREAK????

Fri Dec  4 22:11:27 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed continued expression in a simple if statement where there is a
	comment between the if and the simple statement.

Thu Dec  3 23:38:27 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: cleaned up some documentation

	* cc-mode.el: fixed c++-indent-exp for stream operators

Tue Dec  1 18:01:45 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-backward-over-syntactic-ws should always be given a backlimit in
	c++-calculate-indent.

	* cc-mode.el:
	in previous fix for c++-c-i, it is possible that containing-sexp is
	nil, so use (goto-char (or containing-sexp bod))

	* cc-mode.el:
	enhancements to c++-calculate-indent so that it doesn't assume that
	class opening brace starts in column zero.

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-submit-bug-report now reports whether emacs is patched

Mon Nov 30 23:39:13 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: fixed K&R C arg decl indentations

	* cc-mode.el: cosmetic changes

	* cc-mode.el: removed old c++-bosw which was too slow anyway

Fri Nov 27 20:18:12 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed comment indentation for new c++-comment-only-line-offset
	semantics, and also simplified electric-star and electric-slash. They
	no longer call c++-electric-terminator.

Fri Nov 13 22:42:04 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: some documentation improvements

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed erroneous newline insertion on member init colons when
	c++-auto-newline is off.

	* cc-mode.el: fixed buggy regexp which would fail on this situation:

	int foo(									 // foo
		int arg1,								 // arg1
												 int arg2

	last line gets indented wrong because of the spaces b/w the foo( and
	the comment

	* cc-mode.el: 1. alphabetized varlist in c++-dump-state
	2. improved portability of c++-submit-bug-report for mailers other
	   than vm.

	* cc-mode.el:
	use comment-start-skip instead of hard-coded comment regexp

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. added c++-emacs-is-fixed-p to check for a patched emacs
	2. automatically set c++-untame-characters to nil if patched

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed comment-line indent calculation. now c++-calculate-indent does
	no comment-line calculations, its all handled in c++-indent-line and
	c++-indent-sexp

	* cc-mode.el: slight documentation fixup

	* cc-mode.el:
	vastly improved c++-comment-only-line-offset to provide ability to

Thu Nov 12 16:45:30 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. some experimental performance enhancements (not working really great)

	occurances with c-indent-level.  it caused very bad things when
	c-indent-level != c++-class-member-indent

	* cc-mode.el: c++-match-paren must set parse-sexp-ignore-comments to t

Fri Oct  2 22:31:14 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	continuation indentation problem should now work correctly.
	c++-in-function-p search from containing-sexp or point

	* cc-mode.el:
	added c++-in-function-p defun to be used when checking if we're in a
	function.  Continuations inside a function

	* cc-mode.el: fixed the LCD Archive Entry syntax

	* cc-mode.el: removed c++-fill-C-comment, function is unused anywhere

Tue Sep  1 21:02:17 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: 1. compatibility code for loading into a patched emacs
	2. also a *slightly* improved c++-backward-over-syntactic-ws.  This
	   function needs a drastic overhaul -- I bet its the main performance
	   pig now that emacs is patched.

	* cc-mode.el: better documentation on c++-untame-characters

	* cc-mode.el:
	added some documentation to the front of the file to describe untame
	characters

	* cc-mode.el:
	default value for c++-untame-characters is now just single tick, the
	most troublesome character

Thu Aug 20 19:29:00 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	only check for inside template spec if looking at c++-class-key

	* cc-mode.el:
	attempted to address keyword "class" appearing inside a template
	specification:

	template<class Foo>
	Foo& Bar<Foo>::doit( void ){};

	template<class Foo, class Blat>
	Foo& Bar<Foo>::doit( void ){};

Tue Aug 11 14:06:02 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: more optimizations by passing bod to c++-at-top-level-p

	* cc-mode.el: parameterized c++-class-key and c++-access-key
	the first is class\|struct\|union
	the second is public\|protected\|private

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed (c++-at-top-level-p t) so it won't get fooled by struct declarations.

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-at-top-level-p so it won't get fooled by struct declarations

Tue Aug  4 20:59:29 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

Wed Jul 22 13:28:54 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed (c++-at-top-level-p t) so it wouldn't return non-nil if keyword
	class appears in arglist

	* cc-mode.el:
	added to c++-calculate-indent a check if we're at the bobp

Tue Jul 21 21:59:27 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	new function c++-calculate-c-indent-within-comment used instead of
	calculate-c-indent-within-comment (from c-mode).  Supports 4 styles of
	C block comments.

	Also, new variable c++-C-block-comments-indent-p to control which
	style(s) to use.

Tue Jul 14 21:33:04 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: implemented Brian Kennedy's patches for { if style
	seems to be clean now

	* cc-mode.el:
	better fix to c++-at-top-level-p for limiting backsearching of
	class/struct

	* cc-mode.el: another patch to c++-at-top-level-p, but now slower

	* cc-mode.el:
	Igor Metz's patch to fix c++-uncomment-region for Emacs 19
	derivatives since zap-to-char now works differently

Fri Jul 10 22:02:26 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	in c++-fill-C-comment, its cleaner to use let-bind fill-prefix itself
	instead of saving its value and later restoring it.

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-at-top-level-p never returns non-nil if inside the parens of an
	arg decl list for a function.  Also cleaned up c++-at-top-level-p's
	docstring for new functionality

	* cc-mode.el: 1. added usage notes to top of file

	* cc-mode.el: fixed nested class member init list indentation

Thu Jul  9 21:54:08 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	added c++-class-member-indent to varlist in bug submission

	* cc-mode.el: nested classes!
	added a variable c++-class-member-indent to handle indentation of
	class members relative to their enclosing class

	* cc-mode.el:
	new c++-at-top-level-p function for nested class definitions (does not
	work though)

	* cc-mode.el:
	optimized by changing all references to c++-in-comment-p and
	c++-in-open-string-p to use memq and c++-in-literal.  This should
	overall reduce the number of calls to c++-in-literal, a time consuming
	defun.

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-electric-star will now re-indent the line when typed as the first
	character on a line of a C block style comment continuation

	* cc-mode.el:
	fix to c++-at-top-level-p to ignore struct/class declarations inside a
	defun which are not definitions:

	void foo()
	{
		struct blah;

		// we are not now (c++-at-top-level-p t)

	The function is still not perfect so we really need to rethink this
	algorithm.

	* cc-mode.el:
	collapse all c++-point-* commands into a single c++-point command with
	an argument

Wed Jul  8 19:40:14 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: fixed parse-start setq in c++-calculate-indent

	* cc-mode.el: pasing => parsing

	* cc-mode.el: grammer -> grammar in comment

	* cc-mode.el:
	implemented c++-backward-over-syntactic-ws with help of Tor Lillqvist
	<tml@tik.vtt.fi>  and replaced all occurances of
	c++-backward-over-cpp-directives and c++-skip-backward-to-noncomment.

Mon Jul  6 21:25:17 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	colon and semi-colon are no longer electric inside of literals

	* cc-mode.el: it is possible that c++-beginning-of-defun with
	c++-match-header-strong equal to nil will incorrectly find the
	beginning of defun.  if this happens, c++-parse-state will return a
	null state so we can check for this and then let* bind
	c++-match-header-strongly to t.  Then we re-calculate the beginning of
	the c++ defun.

	Seems to work around the (char-after ...) bug

	* cc-mode.el: swap back to another use of c++-parse-state

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. don't inherit syntax table from c-mode.  Initialize completely from
	   in this file
	2. wrote c++-parse-state to centralize parsing of syntactic context

Tue Jun 30 21:39:23 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed a bug in brace-else-brace cleanup where insertion of new
	(non-else) brace could possibly go way back to clean up old else brace
	constructs.

	* cc-mode.el:
	use new c++-cleanup-list to replace c++-cleanup-brace-else-brace-p and
	c++-cleanup-empty-defun-braces-p, and to implement new cleanup on
	close semi.

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-electric-pound behavior for # directives in a level of
	nesting for alignleft behavior

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-cleanup-empty-defun-braces-p only for defun braces (not for empty
	if braces for example)

	* cc-mode.el:
	only do the extra c++-indent-line in c++-electric-brace if hanging
	braces is turned off

Wed Jun 24 20:07:00 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	added a c++-indent-line in the c++-electric-brace to fix non-hanging
	brace error message.

	* cc-mode.el:
	added function c++-skip-backwards-over-cpp-directives for improved
	indentation around # lines.

Tue Jun 23 19:35:27 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed stream op positioning when first >> or << is on the next
	continued line of the statement.

	* cc-mode.el:
	hacking the mode line should only occur in c++-mode defun, when the
	mode line is a list, otherwise, if people use the obsolete string-only
	form, their mode line will be made invalid.

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed indentation of lines not at top level, which follow preprocessor
	directive lines.

Fri Jun 19 21:46:58 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed bug when access specifier line has a comment at the end of it

	* cc-mode.el: simplified all point-marks to use (point-marker)

Thu Jun 18 15:10:04 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: fixed c++-electric-pound by using insert-before-markers

	* cc-mode.el: 1. added c++-electric-pound command and bound it to #
	2. also added c++-electric-pound-behavior to control how # behaves.
	   Currently only supported behavior is alignleft, but eventually I
	   will support nested behavior as well.
	3. changed the way c++-electric-delete and c++-insert-command work on
	   # lines.  delete is never hungry in the whitespace b/w # and
	   directive, and tab only inserts in this area as well.

	* cc-mode.el:
	added c++-delete-function variable and made c++-electric-delete use
	this variable

Wed Jun 17 22:29:12 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	c++-tab-always-indent is nil

	* cc-mode.el:
	another fix to c++-indent-command for c++-tab-always-indent == nil

	* cc-mode.el:
	made c++-indent-command behavior when c++-tab-always-indent is nil
	consistent with documentation

Thu Jun 11 22:44:47 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	added a test to see if c++-auto-newline actually inserts the newline
	doing the auto-fill

Wed Jun 10 19:10:31 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:

	c++-submit-bug-report uses pop-to-buffer instead of switch-buffer

	* cc-mode.el: refined regexp patch in previous fix

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-calculate-indent int the situation where we're looking at
	the line after a class declaration, but we're not inheriting.  see the
	lines after:
	;; else first check to see if its a
	;; multiple inheritance continuation line

	the regexp should match optional inheritance syntax.

	* cc-mode.el:
	small fix to c++-at-top-level for checking if at top wrt a containing
	class definition. (previous fix didn't work)

	* cc-mode.el:

	indent by c++-friend-offset for all friends, not just class friends

	* cc-mode.el: fixed scan-lists failure in c++-at-top-level-p

	* cc-mode.el: fixed bogus colon entry "premature sexp end" bug

	* cc-mode.el: much preliminary work for inline code proper formatting

	* cc-mode.el: fixed double colon cleanup inside defun level

	* cc-mode.el: added variable c++-cleanup-empty-defun-braces-p

	* cc-mode.el: default value for c++-comment-only-line-offset is now 0

	* cc-mode.el: fixed c++-electric-delete's consuming of [] characters

	* cc-mode.el: c++-cleanup-brace-else-brace-p is now nil by default

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-hanging-member-init-colon for all known situations

	added interactive command c++-version and bound it to C-c C-v

Tue May 12 21:37:20 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: another patch to c++-in-comment-p

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-calculate-indent to ignore parens and such which occur in
	comment regions during the initial iterative parse of the defun.

	* cc-mode.el:
	in c++-in-comment-p, it was necessary to set ?/ temporarily to ". 14"
	class so that c++ style comments wouldn't affect parse-partial-sexp

	* cc-mode.el:
	tab does not insert a C style comment block continuation line when
	point is on or before the first non-whitespace character on the line.

Mon May 11 22:28:30 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: added variable c++-tame-comments-p

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-in-comment-p to handle special case of C style block comments

	* cc-mode.el: added some documentation to c++-mode

	* cc-mode.el:
	C-c C-b is the accepted standard for c++-submit-bug-report

Fri May  8 20:47:38 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. cleaned up all the intro information at the top of the file
	2. added c++-submit-bug-report function and related variables.

	* cc-mode.el: fixed mailing list info

	* cc-mode.el: added information about c++-mode-victims mailing list.

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-tame-comments. now we tame all string and parenthesis class
	characters.

	* cc-mode.el:
	changed syntax of single quote back to string class and added
	c++-electric-tick and c++-tame-ticks defuns to handle backslashifying
	single quotes in comment areas.

Thu May  7 20:03:32 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	added fix by Reed Hastings <reed@adapt.net.com> so that c++-indent-exp
	can properly terminate when // style comments are found within the
	function.

	* cc-mode.el:
	c++-calculate-indent should now not re-indent comment-only lines which
	begin in comment-column

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed c++-electric-terminator insertion when auto-newline fills a long
	line due to auto-fill being on.

	* cc-mode.el:
	comment only lines which continue previous line's comment field would
	probably be indented in comment-column so those comments which begin
	in comment-column don't indent

Wed May  6 17:29:16 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	handle comment-only lines which continue from the previous line.

Mon May  4 23:33:51 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	added a few of Hallvard's speedups (but not the c++-auto-newline one)

	* cc-mode.el: changed all functions to conform to c++-<func> style

	* cc-mode.el:
	changed the variable c-tab-always-indent to c++-tab-always-indent and
	extended this variable's functionality.

	* cc-mode.el: forgot to remove the debug statement

	* cc-mode.el: simplified c++-cleanup-}-else-{-p

Sat May  2 18:12:21 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: changed c++-cleanup-}-else-{ to c++-cleanup-}-else-{-p

Fri May  1 21:09:09 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	beginnings of } else { cleanup, but not completely bugless yet

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed indent-c++-exp. when setting this-indent as max of different
	values, max it with 0 not 1, otherwise some things won't ever end up
	in column zero.

	* cc-mode.el:
	I think I've extended calculate-c++-indent to properly handle
	switch/case statements (at least the style that I use).

Thu Apr 30 22:21:51 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: added c++-backward-to-start-of-do, which is analogous to
	c-backward-to-start-of-if and finds the corresponding preceding do for
	a do/while statement.  made the necessary changes to
	calculate-c++-indent to handle nested do's

	* cc-mode.el:
	this version will now handle continued statements with no compound
	statements on ifs, elses, fors, dos, and whiles.

	* cc-mode.el: add tab-width to the list of variables to dump...

Wed Apr 29 22:23:25 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	simplification of auto-hungry functions and mode-line updates with
	much thanks to Hallvard Furuseth.

	* cc-mode.el:
	copied c++-in-parens-p from c-mode's c-inside-parens-p.  this is so we
	can play with trying to work around emacs' bogus syntax bugs. we'll
	see if the new behavior is any better

	* cc-mode.el:
	eliminate infinite loop bug in c++-indent-defun by using a marker.
	this is necessary since c++-indent-line could change the location of
	the marker and just saving its buffer position is not sufficient.

	* cc-mode.el:
	close parens act like close braces by indenting to c-indent-level
	plus value of c++-block-close-brace-offset.

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed infinite loop problem in c++-indent-defun which was caused by
	substituting forward-line for next-line.

	* cc-mode.el: some changes to calculate-c++-indent defun
	1. fixed unbalanced paren problem (emacs bug) in comment by adding a
	   paren to the j.peck hack comment (probably should eventually clean
	   up these comments)

	2. applied Doug Moore's (dougm@cs.rice.edu) patch to fix continued
	   function declarations of the form:

	   int foo( int i,
		    int j );
	   ^---- next line should only indent to here

	3. cleaned up some comment sections

	* cc-mode.el:
	added the variable c++-block-close-brace-offset for modifying the
	offset of close braces for non-top level blocks (i.e. braces which
	don't close a function).

	* cc-mode.el:
	removed c++-delete-is-hungry-in-literals-p.  Delete key is now,
	*never* hungry inside literals.

Tue Apr 28 22:38:35 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: fixed free variable problems in indent-c++-exp
	1. innerloop-done was let'ed as inner-loop-done. changed all
	   innerloop-done's to inner-loop-done in body of defun

	2. last-depth wasn't let'ed

	* cc-mode.el:
	added c++-delete-is-hungry-in-literals-p to control whether
	hungry-delete consumes whitespace even in literals.

	* cc-mode.el:
	whoops, parse-start was a free variable in c++-at-top-level-p. I just
	added the local binding to the let statement in that defun.

	* cc-mode.el:
	changed c++-hanging-braces-p to c++-hanging-braces. this variable can
	now control whether hanging braces happen always, never, or only on
	non-top level open braces.

	* cc-mode.el: fixed comment-only line related bugs:

	1. comment-only lines not in the first column, but at the top level
	   were inserting all tab characters.

	2. fixed #1, but this caused non-comment top-level lines which follow
	   indented top-level comment-only lines to indent, which they
	   shouldn't do.

	I think this fixes all repercussions of comment-only lines.

	* cc-mode.el:
	replaced all next-line's with forward-line's since next-line is really
	a user level function (and may be overloaded by the user).

Mon Apr 27 16:03:29 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	fixed enum entry bug reported by Rolf Schreiber by patching
	c++-backward-to-noncomment.  it is possible that (max (point-bol) lim)
	is greater than point, which chokes the search-backward call.  I now
	have a test for sblim being less than or equal to point.

Fri Apr 24 22:02:47 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. added documentation in c++-mode for auto-hungry states and related
	   variables.
	2. removed duplicated setq's in c++-mode buffer-local-variable setups

	* cc-mode.el: more header doc information

	* cc-mode.el: cleaned up c++-mode doc string

	* cc-mode.el:
	1. updated mode documentation string for c++-mode to include new
	   variables.

	2. changed c++-auto-hungry-toggle-p to c++-auto-hungry-toggle since it
	   is not a binary valued variable.

	* cc-mode.el:
	changed ' syntax back to string quote instead of punctuation

Thu Apr  9 22:26:00 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

Fri Mar 20 20:38:29 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	made buffer-local c++-auto-newline and c++-hungry-delete-key-p

Thu Mar 19 19:16:14 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el:
	bound c++-toggle-auto-newline function to C-cC-t and compacted info
	mode name

	* cc-mode.el:
	use better mode-line updating than (redraw-display) in c++-toggle-auto-newline

Wed Mar 18 19:52:14 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: fixed display of c++-toggle-auto-newline

Tue Mar 17 21:01:05 1992  Barry A. Warsaw, ITB  (warsaw@anthem)

	* cc-mode.el: test for c++-hungry-delete-key-p (typo)

	* cc-mode.el: added c++-hungry-delete-key-p

	* cc-mode.el: handles auto newline for member init list
